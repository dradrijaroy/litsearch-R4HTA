Objective: we aimed to provide an updated systematic review on the efficacy of tele-rehabilitation interventions for recovery from motor, higher cortical dysfunction, and poststroke depression among stroke survivors. Methods: we searched pubmed and cochrane library from january 1, 1980 to july 15, 2017 using the following keywords: ""telerehabilitation stroke,"" ""mobile health rehabilitation,"" ""telemedicine stroke rehabilitation,"" and ""telerehabilitation."" Our inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials, pilot trials, or feasibility trials that included an intervention group that received any tele-rehabilitation therapy for stroke survivors compared with a control group on usual or standard of care. Results: this search yielded 49 abstracts. By consensus between 2 investigators, 22 publications met the criteria for inclusion and further review. Tele-rehabilitation interventions focused on motor recovery (nâ€‰=â€‰18), depression, or caregiver strain (nâ€‰=â€‰2) and higher cortical dysfunction (nâ€‰=â€‰2). Overall, tele-rehabilitation interventions were associated with significant improvements in recovery from motor deficits, higher cortical dysfunction, and depression in the intervention groups in all studies assessed, but significant differences between intervention versus control groups were reported in 8 of 22 studies in favor of tele-rehabilitation group while the remaining studies reported nonsignificant differences. Conclusion: this updated systematic review provides evidence to suggest that tele-rehabilitation interventions have either better or equal salutary effects on motor, higher cortical, and mood disorders compared with conventional face-to-face therapy.","eng","Tele-rehabilitation and higher cortical dysfunction and motor function and poststroke recovery","27",1

Technology advances and research have expanded use of telehealth in health care delivery. Physical medicine and rehabilitation providers may use telehealth to deliver care to populations with neurologic and musculoskeletal conditions, commonly treated in both acute care and outpatient settings. Patients with impaired mobility and those living in locations with reduced access to care may particularly benefit. Video-teleconferencing has been shown to be effective for management of burn patients during acute rehabilitation, including reduced health care use expenses and less disruptions to care. Telehealth can facilitate developing interprofessional care plans. Patients with neurologic conditions including stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may use telehealth to monitor symptoms and response to treatment. Telehealth also may facilitate occupational and physical therapy programs as well as improve weight management and skin care in patients with chronic conditions. Other applications include imaging review in sports medicine, symptom management and counseling in concussion, traumatic brain injury, and pain management programs. Limitations of telehealth include barriers in establishing relationship between medical provider and patient, ability to perform limited physical examination, and differences in payment models and liability coverage. The expansion of telehealth services is expected to grow and has potential to improve patient satisfaction by delivering high quality and value of care.","English",NA,"9",2

Data sources: six databases (medline, embase, cochrane central, pedro, psycinfo, cinahl) were searched from inception to november 2015 for literature which reported on the outcomes of real-time telerehabilitation for musculoskeletal conditions. Review methods: two reviewers screened 5913 abstracts where 13 studies ( n = 1520) met the eligibility criteria. Methodological quality was assessed using the downs & black 'checklist for measuring quality' tool. Results were pooled for meta-analysis based upon primary outcome measures and reported as standardised mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (ci). Results: aggregate results suggest that telerehabilitation is effective in the improvement of physical function (smd 1.63, 95%ci 0.92-2.33, i(2)=93%), whilst being slightly more favourable (smd 0.44, 95%ci 0.19-0.69, i(2)=58%) than the control cohort following intervention. Sub-group analyses reveals that telerehabilitation in addition to usual care is more favourable (smd 0.64, 95%ci 0.43-0.85, i(2)=10%) than usual care alone, whilst treatment delivered solely via telerehabilitation is equivalent to face-to-face intervention (smd md 0.14, 95% ci -0.10-0.37, i(2) = 0%) for the improvement of physical function.

Telehealth interventions that use information and communication technologies to enable remote excr programme delivery can overcome common access barriers while preserving clinical supervision and individualised exercise prescription. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the benefits of telehealth excr on exercise capacity and other modifiable cardiovascular risk factors compared with traditional excr and usual care, among patients with coronary heart disease (chd). Methods: cinahl, the cochrane library, embase, medline, pubmed and psycinfo were searched from inception through 31 may 2015 for randomised controlled trials comparing telehealth excr with centre-based excr or usual care among patients with chd. Outcomes included maximal aerobic exercise capacity, modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and exercise adherence. Results: 11 trials (n=1189) met eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Physical activity level was higher following telehealth excr than after usual care. Compared with centre-based excr, telehealth excr was more effective for enhancing physical activity level, exercise adherence, diastolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Telehealth and centre-based excr were comparably effective for improving maximal aerobic exercise capacity and other modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusions: telehealth excr appears to be at least as effective as centre-based excr for improving modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and functional capacity, and could enhance excr utilisation by providing additional options for patients who cannot attend centre-based excr. Telehealth excr must now capitalise on technological advances to provide more comprehensive, responsive and interactive interventions.","eng",NA,"102",1

The advantages of virtual reality (vr), augmented reality (ar), gamification, and telerehabilitation have been demonstrated in several medical fields. In this review, we searched the literature for studies using these technologies for orthopedic rehabilitation and analyzed studies' quality, type and field of rehabilitation, patients' characteristics, and outcomes to describe the state of the art of vr, ar, gamification, and telerehabilitation for orthopedic rehabilitation. Methods: a comprehensive search on pubmed, medline, cochrane, cinahl, and embase databases was conducted. This review was performed according to prisma guidelines. Studies published between 2015 and 2020 about remote virtual rehabilitations for orthopedic patients were selected. The methodological index for non-randomized studies (minors) and cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool were used for quality assessment. Results: 24 studies (9 randomized controlled trials (rcts) and 15 non-randomized studies) and 2472 patients were included. Studies mainly concern telerehabilitation (56%), and to a lesser extent vr (28%), ar (28%), and gamification (16%). Remote virtual technologies were used following knee and hip arthroplasty. The majority of included patients were between 40 and 60 years old and had a university degree. Remote virtual rehabilitation was not inferior to face-to-face therapy, and physical improvements were demonstrated by increased clinical scores. Orthopedic virtual remote rehabilitation decreased costs related to transports, hospitalizations, and readmissions. Conclusion: the heterogeneity of included studies prevented a meta-analysis of their results. Age and social context influence adaptability to technology, and this can modify compliance to treatment and outcomes. A good relationship between patient and physiotherapist is essential for treatment compliance and new technologies are useful to maintain clinical interactions remotely. Remote virtual technologies allow the delivery of high-quality care at reduced costs. This is a necessity given the growing demand for orthopedic rehabilitation and increasing costs related to it.

In this shortâ review, we discuss the evidence for remote healthcare delivery in the context of osteoporosis. Introduction: the covid-19 pandemic has undoubtedly had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on the lives of people living with, and at risk of, osteoporosis and those caring for them. With osteoporosis outpatient and fracture liaison services on pause, healthcare organisations have already moved to delivering new and follow-up consultations remotely, where staffing permits, by telephone or video. Methods: in this review, we consider different models of remote care delivery, the evidence for their use, and the possible implications of covid-19 on osteoporosis services. Results: telemedicine is a global term used to describe any use of telecommunication systems to deliver healthcare from a distance and encompasses a range of different scenarios from remote clinical data transfer to remote clinician-patient interactions. Across a range of conditions and contexts, there remains unclear evidence on the acceptability of telemedicine and the effect on healthcare costs. Within the context of osteoporosis management, there is some limited evidence to suggest telemedicine approaches are acceptable to patients but unclear evidence on whether telemedicine approaches support informed drug adherence. Gaps in the evidence pertain to the acceptability and benefits of using telemedicine in populations with hearing, cognitive, or visual impairments and in those with limited health literacy. Conclusion: there is an urgent need for further health service evaluation and research to address the impact of remote healthcare delivery during covid-19 outbreak on patient care, and in the longer term, to identify acceptability and cost- and clinical-effectiveness of remote care delivery on outcomes of relevance to people living with osteoporosis.","English","COVID-19 and FLS and Osteoporosis and Telemedicine","31",1

Telemedicine is one of the services that rely heavily on icts to enable remote patients to communicate with health care professionals; in this case, the patient communicates with the health care professional for a follow-up or for a consultation about his or her health condition. This communication process is referred to as an e-consultation. In this paper, telemedicine services refer to health care services that use icts, which enable patients to share, transfer, and communicate data or information in real time (ie, synchronous) from their home with a care provider-normally a physician-at a clinical site. However, the use of e-consultation services can be positively or negatively influenced by external or internal factors. External factors refer to the environment surrounding the system as well as the system itself, while internal factors refer to user behavior and motivation. Objective: this review aims to investigate the barriers and the facilitators that influence the use of home consultation systems in the health care context. This review also aims to identify the effectiveness of home online health consultation (hohc) systems in improving patients' health as well as their satisfaction with the systems. Methods: we conducted a systematic literature review to search for articles-empirical studies-about online health consultation in four digital libraries: scopus, association for computing machinery, pubmed, and web of science. The database search yielded 2518 articles; after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the number of included articles for the final review was 45. A qualitative content analysis was performed to identify barriers and facilitators to hohc systems, their effectiveness, and patients' satisfaction with them. Results: the systematic literature review identified several external and internal facilitators and barriers to hohc systems that were used in the creation of a hohc framework. The framework consists of four requirements; the framework also consists of 17 facilitators and eight barriers, which were further categorized as internal and external influencers on hohc. Conclusions: patients from different age groups and with different health conditions benefited from remote health services. Hohc via video conferencing was effective in delivering online treatment and was well-accepted by patients, as it simulated in-person, face-to-face consultation. Acceptance by patients increased as a result of online consultation facilitators that promoted effective and convenient remote treatment. However, some patients preferred face-to-face consultation and showed resistance to online consultation. Resistance to online consultation was influenced by some of the identified barriers. Overall, the framework identified the facilitators and barriers that positively and negatively influenced the uptake of hohc systems, respectively.","English","*barriers and *eHealth and *electronic consultation and *facilitators and *mHealth and *mobile health and *online consultation and *video conferencing","22",2

Methods: we searched the cochrane, pubmed, medline, embase, cinahl and pedro databases from 2000 to 2015 for randomised controlled trials, comparing exercise-based telemedicine intervention to no intervention or usual care in adults with chronic pain. Primary outcome data were pooled using random effect meta-analysis. Primary outcomes were pain, physical activity (pa), limitations in activities of daily living (adl) and quality of life (qol). Secondary outcomes were barriers, facilitators and usability of telemedicine. Results: sixteen studies were included. Meta-analyses were performed in three subgroups of studies with comparable control conditions. Telemedicine versus no intervention showed significantly lower pain scores (md -0.57, 95% ci -0.81; -0.34), but not for telemedicine versus usual care (md -0.08, 95% ci -0.41; 0.26) or in addition to usual care (md -0.25, 95% ci -1.50; 1.00).

Tm overcomes 2 barriers that patients face when seeking health care: distance and time. It is as effective as in-person visits for outpatient treatment of asthma, and it is a convenient way to provide inpatient consultations for patients when the allergist practices outside of the hospital. Tm also has been used to manage patients with asthma in schools. Patients tend to be as satisfied with tm or they prefer tm over in-person visits, but infrequently they do prefer in-person visits. In addition to virtual visits using tm, there are several emerging technologies that are relevant to the practice of allergy/immunology including electronic diaries (eg, symptoms and medication use), wearable technology (eg, to monitor activity and vital signs), remote patient monitoring (eg, environmental exposures and medication adherence) as well as electronic medical records augmented with clinical decision support. We believe that the use of tm, particularly when combined with information technologies such as electronic health records, has the potential to cause a transformational change in the way care is delivered by altering the process of interaction between patient and provider. Tm addresses the shortage of allergy specialists in rural and underserved urban communities and facilitates patient access to allergy services. As patients take more control of their health care, use of tm is likely to increase because a large part of the move to adopt tm is driven by patient preference.","eng","*Telemedicine and *e-consults and *facilitated visit and *remote patient monitoring and *store & forward and *virtual visit","145",1

This review aims to investigate whether it is feasible to combine virtual reality (vr) which allows exercising in game-like environments with tele-rehabilitation in a community-dwelling stroke population. Methods: literature searches were conducted in five databases, for example, pubmed and the cochrane library. Randomized controlled trial (rct) and non-rct investigating feasibility and effectiveness of vr-based tele-rehabilitation were included. Based on the risk of bias and study design, methodological quality is ranked according to the grade guidelines. Results: seven studies (nâ€‰=â€‰120) were included, of which four are rcts. Evidence regarding therapy adherence and perceived enjoyment of vr, as well as a cost-benefit of tele-rehabilitation emphasizes feasibility. Equal effects are reported comparing this approach to a therapist-supervised intervention in the clinical setting on balance and functional mobility. Conclusions: tele-rehabilitation could be a promising tool to overcome burdens that restrict accessibility to rehabilitation in the future. Vr can increase motivation allowing longer and more training sessions in community-dwelling stroke survivors. Therefore, combining the benefits of both approaches seems convenient. Although evidence is still sparse, functional improvements seem to be equal compared to a similar intervention with therapist-supervision in the clinic, suggesting that for cost-efficient rehabilitation parts of therapy can be transferred to the homes. Implications for rehabilitation the use of tele-rehabilitation could be a promising tool to overcome burdens that restrict the access of stroke survivors to long-term rehabilitative care.

With alcohol-related injuries being one of the leading causes of preventable deaths, there is a dire need to find ways to assist those suffering from alcohol dependence. There still exists a gap in knowledge as to the potential of telemedicine in improving health outcomes for those patients suffering from aud. Objective: the purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the measures of effectiveness, efficiency, and quality that result from the utilization of telemedicine in the management of alcohol abuse, addiction, and rehabilitation. Methods: this review was conducted utilizing the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. The articles used in this analysis were gathered using keywords inclusive of both telemedicine and alcohol abuse, which were then searched in the cumulative index to nursing and allied health literature, cochrane, and medline (pubmed) databases. A total of 22 articles were chosen for analysis. Results: the results indicated that telemedicine reduced alcohol consumption. Other common outcomes included reduced depression (4/35, 11%), increased patient satisfaction (3/35, 9%), increase in accessibility (3/35, 9%), increased quality of life (2/35, 6%), and decreased cost (1/35, 3%). Interventions included mobile health (11/22, 50%), electronic health (6/22, 27%), telephone (3/33, 14%), and 2-way video (2/22, 9%). Studies were conducted in 3 regions: the united states (13/22, 59%), the european union (8/22, 36%), and australia (1/22, 5%). Conclusions: telemedicine was found to be an effective tool in reducing alcohol consumption and increasing patients' accessibility to health care services or health providers. The group of articles for analysis suggested that telemedicine may be effective in reducing health care costs and improving the patient's quality of life.

As a result, the dermatological arena has been under notable pressure to amplify access. Teledermatology has entailed the use of technology to provide dermatological services to individuals located at a remote distance. The purpose of this literature review was to examine the effect of utilization of teledermatology to determine enhancement of dermatological access to residents of rural areas. Materials and methods: this review followed a systematic approach and utilized five electronic databases to obtain peer-reviewed journal articles. A prisma approach was used and a total of 86 references were employed. Results: teledermatology programs have been able to complement conventional dermatological care to enhance dermatological access to rural areas that have suffered from a shortage of dermatologists and could aid in supplementing traditional care as well. Within rural settings, the results of three studies in this review indicated the importance of improved quality for diagnostic precision, whereas one study reported that clinical images might not provide sufficient insight to deliver clear-cut diagnoses. In addition, enhancements in diagnostic precision could be obtained by upgrades in phone cameras to capture images. Finally, to most of the existing literature, in using teledermatology, physician satisfaction has been stronger than patient satisfaction. Conclusions: teledermatology has had a beneficial impact in improving dermatological access to rural areas.

These barriers are particularly apparent in the case of veteran populations, which is the focus of this review. Whilst the research investigating the efficacy of online video therapy to treat mental health issues among veterans is promising, widespread adoption and utilisation of this modality remains low with efforts often failing to progress past the pilot phase to implementation. This review focuses on the implementation of online video therapy in veteran mental health care settings and aims to identify the potential barriers and facilitators relevant to implementing the modality in military organisations. Methods: a systematic search of three databases (psycinfo, pubmed, and web of science) was conducted. To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to investigate the challenges, lessons learnt, or factors operating as barriers and/or facilitators to the implementation of online video therapy in veteran health care systems. Results: the initial search revealed a total of 202 articles. This was reduced to 133 when duplicates were removed. After screening the titles and abstracts a further 70 articles were excluded leaving 63 to be retrieved for full review. A total of 10 studies were included in this review. The most commonly reported barriers were related to clinician concerns, logistical problems, and technology. Other barriers included access to resources as well as challenges posed by collaborations, policy and recruitment. Facilitators included experience using the modality and having dedicated staff responsible for promoting and managing the new service (e.g., on-site champions and telehealth technicians). Conclusions: this review suggests that numerous barriers must be identified and addressed before attempting to implement an online video therapy service in veteran organisations.

Conclusions: while these early studies are promising, more robust studies involving more patients and more institutions are needed to identify opportunities where telemedicine can impact health outcomes, patient-centeredness, or costs of care of neonates.","English","*pediatrics and *technology and *telehealth and *telemedicine","25",2

This review examines the evidence for telehealth in facilitating chronic conditions management with indigenous peoples. Methods: databases were systematically searched for qualitative or quantitative primary research studies that investigated telehealth use for chronic conditions management with indigenous peoples worldwide. Evidence of effectiveness was by consumer health outcomes, evidence of acceptability was through consumer and user perception, and health service feasibility was evident by service impact. Data were assessed for quality and data extracted using pre-defined tools. Results: articles (<i>n</i>=32) examined effectiveness (<i>n</i>=11), critiqued telehealth from the perspectives of the client (<i>n</i>=10) and healthcare professionals (<i>n</i>=8), and examined feasibility (<i>n</i>=12). Studies reported indigenous people tend to be satisfied with telehealth, but are sceptical about its cultural safety. Evidence for the effectiveness of telehealth from a western biomedical perspective was found. Conclusions: telehealth is promising; however, a lack of robust studies in this review make tangible conclusions difficult. A better overall understanding of telehealth use with indigenous peoples, including delivery of culturally competent health care, true consultation and cultural competency of the professionals involved, would be helpful. Telehealth may have the potential to improve health care for indigenous people, however the modality needs to be culturally competent and the care received must be culturally safe.","eng","*Diabetes and *Ear, Nose and Throat and *Indigenous health and *Nursing and *Public Health and *Qualitative Research and *Rehabilitation and *chronic condition and *systematic review and *telehealth","17",1

Indeed, providing care-at-distance via vc is believed to be promising for some situations and patients, serving their needs without associated concomitant costs. In order to assess implementation and perceived benefits, patient satisfaction is frequently measured. Measuring patient satisfaction with vc in healthcare is often performed using quantitative and qualitative outcome analysis. As studies employ different surveys, pooling of data on the topic is troublesome. This systematic review critically appraises, summarizes, and compares available questionnaires in order to identify the most suitable questionnaire for qualitative outcome research using vc in clinical outpatient care. Methods: pubmed, embase, and cochrane were searched for relevant articles using predefined inclusion criteria. Methodological quality appraisal of yielded questionnaires to assess vc was performed using the validated cosmin guideline. Results: this systematic search identified twelve studies that used ten different patient satisfaction questionnaires. The overall quality of nine questionnaires was rated as ""inadequate"" to ""doubtful"" according to the cosmin criteria. None of the questionnaires retrieved completed a robust validation process for the purpose of use. Conclusion and recommendations: although high-quality studies on measurement properties of these questionnaires are scarce, the questionnaire developed by mekhjian has the highest methodological quality achieving validity on internal consistency and the use of a large sample size. Moreover, this questionnaire can be used across healthcare settings.

The reasons for poor oral health amongst underserved populations are multiple, but rests with socio-economic determinants of health. The present review considers international workforce models that have been created to enhance the recruitment and retention of dental providers in rural areas. Several strategies have been developed to address care access problems in rural areas, including the use of telemedicine and mid-level dental providers (mldps). Despite ongoing opposition from dentistry organisations, the alaska and minnesota workforce models have proven that developing and deploying dental therapists from rural communities has the potential to address the unmet needs of underserved populations. It is more efficient and cost-effective for mldps to perform triage and treat simple cases and for dentists to treat complicated cases. The use of mldps is intended to increase the capacity of the dental workforce in areas that are too isolated to entice dentists. Telemedicine has emerged as one solution to address limited access to health care, particularly in locations where there is a lack of providers. Telemedicine not only provides access to care, but also offers support, consultations and access to continuing education for practicing dental providers in rural areas. This strategy has the potential to free up resources to increase care access and reduce oral health disparities, thereby contributing to closing the rural-urban oral health gap.","eng","Telemedicine and dental therapist and disparity and oral health and remote and rural and workforce","66",1

We sought to obtain a baseline and document trends regarding the use of telemedicine id (teleid) consults as an adjunct to the standard of care through the time period in which teleid consultations were introduced. Methods: data were pulled via manual, retrospective chart reviews of the electronic medical record. Primary outcomes included lengths of stay (los), antibiotic usage, and relapse incidences. Results: there were a total of 244 patients at 1 remote hospital site who were provided with id consultations, either in person, via teleid, or both. Before the availability of teleid (pre-teleid), there were 73 patients transferred for id consults, while 171 patients were seen via teleid once available. While all 73 patients in the pre-teleid group were transferred from the remote hospital to the hub hospital, only 14 (8.2%) of all remote hospital patients assessed by teleid were transferred.

Young people face multiple barriers to accessing effective contraception in clinical settings. This article reviews innovations in contraceptive access. Recent findings: the three biggest innovations are over-the-counter oral contraceptives (otc-ocs), pharmacist-prescribing, and web-based telehealth platforms. In many countries, oral contraceptives are available otc, and fda trials for otc-ocs are underway in the united states. Many states have passed legislation allowing pharmacists to prescribe contraceptives after a brief health screening. Web-based telehealth platforms also provide prescription contraceptive access. There is a small but growing body of literature that demonstrates young people's interest in, and capacity to consent to, hormonal contraceptives in nontraditional settings. State-to-state variability in minor consent, pharmacist prescribing, and telehealth laws act as barriers to young people's access to these newer options. Summary: access to hormonal contraception is expanding outside of clinical settings, reducing barriers. Adolescents' unique needs should be considered in the design, implementation, and evaluation of these new approaches.

Results: the analysis included 55 randomized controlled trials with a total of 9258 patients with diabetes, out of which 4607 were randomized to telemedicine groups and 4651 to conventional, non-telemedicine care groups. The results favored telemedicine over conventional care (hedges's g=-0.48, p<0.001) in diabetes management. The beneficial effect of telemedicine were more pronounced among patients with type 2 diabetes (hedges's g=-0.63, p<0.001) than among those with type 1 diabetes (hedges's g=-0.27, p=0.027) (q=4.25, p=0.04). Conclusions: compared to conventional care, telemedicine is more effective in improving treatment outcomes for diabetes patients, especially for those with type 2 diabetes.","eng","Diabetes management and Meta-analysis and Telemedicine","116",1

Several strategies have been adopted with the aim to reduce any delay in diagnosis of ami: pre-hospital triage with telemedicine is one of such strategies. We therefore aimed to measure the real effect of pre-hospital triage with telemedicine in case of ami in a meta-analysis study. Methods: we performed a meta-analysis of non-randomized studies with the aim to quantify the exact reduction of time to treatment achieved by pre-hospital triage with telemedicine. Data were pooled and compared by relative time reduction and 95% c.i.s. A meta-regression analysis was performed in order to find possible predictors of shorter time to treatment. Results: eleven studies were selected and finally evaluated in the study. The overall relative reduction of time to treatment with pre-hospital triage and telemedicine was - 38/- 40% ( p < 0.001). Absolute time reduction was significantly correlated to time to treatment in the control groups ( p < 0.001), while relative time reduction was independent. A non-significant trend toward shorter relative time reductions was observed over years. Conclusions: pre-hospital triage with telemedicine is associated with a near halved time to treatment in ami.

This may be a unique opportunity to promote and expand alternative models of health-care delivery in patients undergoing renal replacement therapies. Summary: despite the high risk of acquiring communicable diseases when undergoing in-centre treatments, only a small proportion of patients are currently being treated with home therapies. Recent data provided by the italian society of nephrology (sin), the rein french registry and the wuhan hemodialysis quality control center clearly show that patients receiving hospital-based treatment have a 3- to 4-fold greater risk of infection, and a subsequent fatality proportion between 21 and 34%. On the other hand, home-based therapy can be managed remotely, there is little or no need for transport to and from the hospital, and it is less expensive. Besides, the digital revolution in health care with the development of virtual care systems can make home dialysis with telehealth a cost-effective solution for both patients and health-care providers. Such a transition would require specific training for physicians and health-care professionals and a functional re-organization of dialysis centres to improve the skills and expertise in caring for patients at home.

Introduction:memorial sloan kettering (msk) experienced a rapid evolution from delivery of in-person cessation counseling services to virtual telehealth treatments for our tobacco-dependent cancer patients. Aim:to examine the effect of rapid scaling of tobacco treatment telehealth on patient engagement, as measured by attendance rates for in-person counseling visits versus remote telehealth counseling visits. We also describe the patient, clinician, and health care system challenges encountered in rapid expansion of individual and group tobacco telehealth services. Methods:data collected from the electronic medical record during the first 4 months of the covid-19 pandemic were examined for tobacco treatment counseling. Results:from january 1, 2020 to march 30, 2020, markedly improved patient engagement was observed in ambulatory tobacco treatment services with greater attendance at scheduled telehealth visits than in-person visits, 75% versus 60.3%, odds ratio 1.84 (confidence interval: 1.26-2.71; p < 0.001). In addition, bedside hospital counseling visits were transformed into inpatient telephone visits with high levels of sustained patient engagement. Lastly, group telehealth services were launched rapidly to increase capacity and provide greater psychosocial support for cancer patients struggling with tobacco dependence. Discussion:clinical, information technology (it), and hospital system barriers were successfully addressed for most cancer patients seeking individual telehealth treatment. Group telehealth services were found to be feasible and acceptable.

This study seeks to examine patient feedback of a national telestroke system within the veterans health administration. Methods: patients who received a telestroke consultation were eligible for a phone interview 2 weeks later, including questions about technology quality, telepresence, and telestroke provider communication. Satisfaction scores ranged from 1 to 7 (higher=more satisfied) and for analyses were dichotomized as 6 to 7 indicating high satisfaction versus <6. Patient variables including stroke severity (measured by the national institutes of health stroke scale) were obtained from study records. Generalized estimating equation models were used to determine what factors were associated with patient satisfaction. Results: over 18 months, 186 interviews were completed, and 142 (76%) reported high satisfaction with telestroke. Patients with more severe stroke were less likely to recall the consultation. Factors significantly associated with patient satisfaction were higher ratings of the technology (p<0.0001), telepresence (p<0.0001), provider communication ratings (p<0.0001), and overall veterans affairs satisfaction (p=0.02). In the multivariate model, telepresence (odds ratio, 3.10 [95% ci, 1.81-5.31]) and provider ratings (odds ratio, 2.37 [95% ci, 1.20-4.68]) were independently associated with satisfaction.

These works span a wide range of research areas to enhance telemedicine architecture such as network communications, artificial intelligence methods and techniques, iot wearable sensors and hardware devices, smartphones and cloud computing. Accordingly, several telemedicine applications covering various human diseases have presented their works from a specific perspective and resulted in confusion regarding the iot characteristics. Although such applications are useful and necessary for improving telemedicine contexts related to monitoring, detection and diagnostics, deriving an overall picture of how iot characteristics are currently integrated with the telemedicine architecture is difficult. Accordingly, this study complements the academic literature with a systematic review covering all main aspects of advances in iot-based telemedicine architecture. This study also provides a state-of-the-art telemedicine classification taxonomy under iot and reviews works in different fields in relation to that classification. To this end, this study checked the sciencedirect, institute of electrical and electronics engineers (ieee) xplore, and web of science databases. A total of 2121 papers were collected from 2014 to july 2020. The retrieved articles were filtered according to the defined inclusion criteria. A final set of 141 articles were selected and classified into two categories, each followed by subcategories and sections. The first category includes an iot-based telemedicine network that accounts for 24.11% (n = 34/141). The second category includes iot-based telemedicine healthcare services and applications that account for 75.89% (n = 107/141). This multi-field systematic review has exposed new research opportunities, motivations, recommendations and challenges that need attention for the synergistic integration of interdisciplinary works. This extensive study also lists a set of open issues and provides innovative key solutions along with a systematic review. The classification of diseases under iot-based telemedicine is divided into 14 groups. Furthermore, the crossover in our taxonomy is demonstrated. The lifecycle of the context of iot-based telemedicine healthcare applications is mapped for the first time, including the procedure sequencing and definition for each context. We believe that this study is a useful guide for researchers and practitioners in providing direction and valuable information for future research.

Design, setting, and participants in this cohort study, a retrospective medical record review was conducted from march 16 to may 11, 2020, of all patients scheduled for telemedicine visits in primary care and specialty ambulatory clinics at a large academic health system. Age, race/ethnicity, sex, language, median household income, and insurance type were all identified from the electronic medical record. Main outcomes and measures a successfully completed telemedicine visit and video (vs telephone) visit for a telemedicine encounter. Multivariable models were used to assess the association between sociodemographic factors, including sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and language, and the use of telemedicine visits, as well as video use specifically. Results a total of 148 402 unique patients (86 055 women [58.0%]; mean [sd] age, 56.5 [17.7] years) had scheduled telemedicine visits during the study period; 80 780 patients (54.4%) completed visits.

This was a sudden change for most practices and patients. This research aimed to explore how patients accessed general practice during lockdown and evaluate their experiences with telehealth, to inform how telehealth could be most effectively used in the future. Methods using a mixed-method approach, we undertook an online survey and in-depth interviews with adults (> 18 years) who had contact with practices during lockdown, recruited through social media and email lists. We present descriptive statistics from the survey data (n = 1010) and qualitative analysis of interview data (n = 38) and open-ended survey questions, using a framework of access to health care, from the patient's perspective. Results in general, patients reported high satisfaction with telehealth in general practice during lockdown. Telehealth was convenient and allowed patients to safely access health care without having to weigh-up the fear of covid-19 infection against the need to be seen. Telehealth worked best for routine and familiar health issues and when rapport was established between patients and clinicians. This was easier with a pre-existing clinical relationship, but not impossible without one. Telehealth was less suitable when a physical examination was needed, when the diagnosis was unknown or for patients who had a strong preference to be seen in-person. Conclusions even in this disruptive lockdown period, that prompted an unexpected and rapid implementation of telehealth services in general practices, most patients had positive experiences with telehealth. In the future, patients want the choice of consultation type to match their needs, circumstances, and preferences. Technological issues and funding barriers may need to be addressed, and clear communication for both patients and clinicians is needed about key aspects of telehealth (e.g. cost, appropriateness, privacy).

Data were from video-recorded nhs health check (nhshc) consultations captured as part of the uk risk communication (rico) study; a qualitative study of video-recorded nhshc consultations from 12 general practices in the west midlands, uk. Participants were those eligible for nhshc based on national criteria (40-74 years old, no existing diagnoses for cardiovascular-related conditions, not on statins), and practitioners, who delivered the nhshc. Method: nhshcs were video-recorded. One hundred twenty-eight consultations were transcribed and analysed using deductive thematic analysis and coded using a template based around protection motivation theory. Results: key themes used to frame the analysis were cognitive appraisal (threat appraisal, and coping appraisal), and coping modes (adaptive, and maladaptive). Analysis showed little evidence of cvd risk communication, particularly in consultations using qrisk (r) 2. Practitioners often missed opportunities to check patient understanding and encourage risk- reducing behaviour, regardless of the risk calculator used resulting in practitioner verbal dominance. Jbs3 appeared to better promote opportunities to initiate risk-factor discussion, and heart age and visual representation of risk were more easily understood and impactful than 10-year percentage risk. However, a lack of effective cvd risk discussion in both risk calculator groups increased the likelihood of a maladaptive coping response. Conclusions: the analysis demonstrates the importance of effective, shared practitioner-patient discussion to enable adaptive coping responses to cvd risk information, and highlights a need for effective and evidence-based practitioner training.","English","Cardiovascular disease; Risk communication; NHS health check; Chronic and disease prevention","21",1

Covid-19 challenges and needs required health systems to rapidly redesign the delivery of care. Materials and methods: our health system deployed 4 covid-19 telehealth programs and 4 biomedical informatics innovations to screen and care for covid-19 patients. Using programmatic and electronic health record data, we describe the implementation and initial utilization. Results: through collaboration across multidisciplinary teams and strategic planning, 4 telehealth program initiatives have been deployed in response to covid-19: virtual urgent care screening, remote patient monitoring for covid-19-positive patients, continuous virtual monitoring to reduce workforce risk and utilization of personal protective equipment, and the transition of outpatient care to telehealth. Biomedical informatics was integral to our institutional response in supporting clinical care through new and reconfigured technologies. Through linking the telehealth systems and the electronic health record, we have the ability to monitor and track patients through a continuum of covid-19 services. Discussion: covid-19 has facilitated the rapid expansion and utilization of telehealth and health informatics services. We anticipate that patients and providers will view enhanced telehealth services as an essential aspect of the healthcare system. Continuation of telehealth payment models at the federal and private levels will be a key factor in whether this new uptake is sustained. Conclusions: there are substantial benefits in utilizing telehealth during the covid-19, including the ability to rapidly scale the number of patients being screened and providing continuity of care.","English","telehealth; informatics; pandemic; health systems","27",1

Design a feasibility study based on bowen's framework was used to determine demand, acceptability, limited efficacy and practicality of telerehabilitation. The study involved qualitative and quantitative data analysis. Setting two victorian community rehabilitation programs providing services to large geographical catchment zones in the outer fringe of a metropolitan area. Participants ten adult clients receiving home-based therapy and 5 allied health clinicians working in the program. Interventions clients participated in a single review therapy appointment (telerehabilitation) from physiotherapy, dietetics or speech pathology using the health network's videoconferencing platfrom and the client's own electronic device. Main outcome measures demand was assessed by calculating the percentage of eligible clients able to participate compared to total number of home-based clients. Acceptability, practicality and limited efficacy were explored through qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews. Results nearly one quarter of clients screened met eligibility criteria, indicating a large potential demand for telerehabilitation. Telerehabilitation was highly acceptable for clinicians and clients participating in speech pathology and dietitian sessions as these contain targeted education and talking-based therapy. It was less accepted in physiotherapy, where there is a more hands-on approach. Telerehabilitation was practical and efficient for both clinicians and clients, especially when time was allowed for training and initial troubleshooting. Conclusion telerehabilitation is a feasible modality for review sessions in community rehabilitation and helps improve efficient use of clinician and client time. It is more appropriate for disciplines that use education and talking-based therapy compared with hands-on therapy.

In this short communication, we trace a particular perspective for the application of telemedicine for pwes undergoing ketogenic diet (kd) treatment, considering the social and economic difficulties faced by healthcare teams in resource-poor countries, such as brazil. During the pandemic, financial strain was the main impediment to following kd. The pandemic increased socioeconomic insecurity and access to kd-related products, as well as increasing anxiety in 71% of pwe, impacting their kd treatment follow-up.

However, many children with fxs have limited access to behavioral treatments that have known efficacy due to the low availability of treatment providers and the wide geographical dispersion of families with fxs across the country. Telehealth may offer a cost-effective and practical solution to overcome these significant barriers. We examined the effect of administering an established behavior analytic intervention called functional communication training (fct) via telehealth on levels of problem behaviors exhibited by boys with fxs. We also examined treatment acceptability, as well as the effect of the treatment on levels of parenting stress. Methods: boys with fxs, aged 3 to 10 years, who displayed problem behaviors daily, were randomized to receive fct via telehealth (n = 30) or treatment as usual (n = 27) over 12 weeks. Outcome measures included in-session observations of problem behavior, the aberrant behavior checklist-community (abc-c), the treatment acceptability rating form-revised (tarf-r), and the parenting stress index, 4th edition (psi-4). Results: intention-to-treat analyses indicated that scores on the irritability subscale of the abc-c, our primary outcome measure, decreased significantly for boys who received fct via telehealth compared to boys who received treatment as usual (p < .001, cohen's d = 0.65). In-session observations conducted for those who received treatment showed that levels of problem behavior decreased by 91% from baseline. Levels of parenting stress related to child behavioral problems were also lower following fct treatment, and caregivers reported that the intervention was acceptable. Conclusions: these findings support telehealth-enabled fct as a framework for expanding access to behavioral treatments for problem behaviors in children with fxs. Expanded delivery of behavior analytic treatment via telehealth also has the potential to lower healthcare costs, improve child and family quality of life, and lead to advances in the treatment of problem behavior in the broader population of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders.","English","Fragile X syndrome; Problem behavior; Functional analysis; Behavioral and treatment; Randomized controlled trial","12",1

Methods: we merged county-level measures of social distancing through april 18, 2020 to detailed administrative data on substance use treatment facilities. We then calculated the number and share of treatment facilities that offered telehealth services by whether residents of the county social distanced or not. Finally, we estimated a logistic regression that predicted the offering of telehealth services using both county- and facility-level characteristics. Results: approximately 27% of substance use facilities in the u.s. reported telehealth availability at the outset of the pandemic. Treatment facilities in counties with a greater social distancing were less likely to possess telemedicine capability. Similarly, nonopioid treatment programs that offered buprenorphine or vivitrol in counties with a greater burden of covid-19 were less likely to offer telemedicine when compared to similar facilities in counties with a lower burden of covid-19. Conclusions: relatively few substance use treatment facilities offered telehealth services at the onset of the covid-19 pandemic.

Despite this, the evidence surrounding the safety of remote consultations is inconclusive. The appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing in remote consultations is an important aspect of patient safety that needs to be addressed. Objective: this study aimed to summarize evidence on the impact of remote consultation in primary care with regard to antibiotic prescribing. Methods: searches were conducted in medline, embase, hmic, psycinfo, and cinahl for literature published since the databases' inception to february 2020. Peer-reviewed studies conducted in primary health care settings were included. All remote consultation types were considered, and studies were required to report any quantitative measure of antibiotic prescribing to be included in this systematic review. Studies were excluded if there were no comparison groups (face-to-face consultations). Results: in total, 12 studies were identified. Of these, 4 studies reported higher antibiotic-prescribing rates, 5 studies reported lower antibiotic-prescribing rates, and 3 studies reported similar antibiotic-prescribing rates in remote consultations compared with face-to-face consultations. Guideline-concordant prescribing was not significantly different between remote and face-to-face consultations for patients with sinusitis, but conflicting results were found for patients with acute respiratory infections. Mixed evidence was found for follow-up visit rates after remote and face-to-face consultations. Conclusions: there is insufficient evidence to confidently conclude that remote consulting has a significant impact on antibiotic prescribing in primary care. However, studies indicating higher prescribing rates in remote consultations than in face-to-face consultations are a concern. Further, well-conducted studies are needed to inform safe and appropriate implementation of remote consulting to ensure that there is no unintended impact on antimicrobial resistance.","English","remote consultations; antibiotic; primary health care; systematic and review; consultation; telehealth; COVID-19; safety; prescription","22",1

Before telehealth, children and families may wait weeks for psychiatric evaluation. Introduction: increasing numbers of pediatric patients are reporting the need for mental health care when they present to region's rural emergency departments (eds). Outcomes of telemental health services were evaluated, with a focus on treatment throughput and referral. Materials and methods: observational 18-month program evaluation of outcomes for children age <18 years (n = 87) who received physical and mental health assessment by an ed physician. Children who subsequently received a mental health diagnosis were treated by a psychiatrist via telemental health visits (september 2017-may 2019) in 4 rural eds. Results: the majority of children (ages 5-17) presented with depression- or anxiety-related disorders (49%) or suicidal ideation/attempt or self-harm (46%), with substance abuse accounting for 5% of cases. Mean ed wait times were 29 min [95% ci: 6-52 min] for children admitted to inpatient (ip) care compared with 33 min [95% ci: 22-43 min] for those discharged to outpatient (op) care. Mean length of stay (los) of 8 h 56 min [95% ci: 166-906 min] was observed for children admitted to ip care compared with mean los of 6 h 58 min [95% ci: 382-454 min] for those discharged to op care (p = 0.072). For suicidality cases, children who were subsequently admitted to ip care experienced a significantly longer mean los of 12 h 30 min [95% ci: 279-1221 min] compared with a mean los of 7 h 13 min [95% ci: 346-520 min; p = 0.015] for children discharged to op care.

Design: observational cohort study with historical control. Setting: tertiary referral outpatient institute. Participants: consecutive services provided to patients with spinal disorders (n=1207). Interventions: telemedicine services included teleconsultations and telephysiotherapy, and lasted as long as usual interventions. They were delivered using free teleconference apps, caregivers were actively involved, and interviews and counseling were performed as usual. Teleconsultations included standard, but adapted, measurements and evaluations by video and from photographs and videos sent in advance according to specific tutorials. During telephysiotherapy, new sets of exercises were defined and recorded as usual. Main outcome measures: we compared the number of services provided in 3 phases, including corresponding periods in 2018 and 2019. During the control (30 working d) and covid-19 surge (13d) only usual consultations and physiotherapy were provided; during the telemed phase (15d), only teleconsultations and telephysiotherapy were provided. If a reliable medical decision was not possible during teleconsultations, usual face-to-face interventions were prescribed. Continuous quality improvement questionnaires were also evaluated. Results: during telemed, 325 teleconsulations and 882 telephysiotherapy sessions were provided in 15 days. We found a rapid decrease (-39%) of outpatient services from the control to the covid- 19 phase (r-2=0.85), which partially recovered in the telemed phase for telephysiotherapy (from -37% to -21%; p<.05) and stabilized for teleconsultation (from -55% to -60%) interventions. Usual face-to-face interventions were required for 0.5% of patients. Patients' satisfaction with telemedicine was very high (2.8 out of 3). Conclusions: telemedicine is feasible and allows medical professionals to continue providing outpatient services with a high level of patient satisfaction. During the current pandemic, this experience can provide a viable alternative for many outpatient services while reducing the need for travel and face-to-face contact to a minimum.

The purpose of this brief report was to describe the feasibility of and satisfaction with telerehabilitation. A total of 205 participants completed online surveys after a telerehabilitation visit. Most commonly, participants were women (53.7%), 35-64 yrs old, and completed physical therapy (53.7%) for established visits of 30-44 mins in duration for primary impairments in sports, lower limb injuries, and pediatric neurology. Overall, high ratings (""excellent"" or ""very good"" responses) were observed for all patient-centered outcome metrics (range, 93.7%-99%) and value in future telehealth visit (86.8%) across telerehabilitation visits. Women participated more frequently and provided higher ratings than male participants did. Other benefits included eliminating travel time, incorporating other health care advocates, and convenience delivering care in familiar environment to pediatric patients.

Objective to understand participant experience of accessing an adapted programme via videoconference. Participants adults with obesity (bmi >= 35kg/m(2)), referred to an nhs dietetics service in wales, were offered a group videoconference weight management programme as an optional alternative to in-person groups. Thirteen participants (mean age 48.5 +/- 20.2 years, 8 female) recruited to two videoconference groups were interviewed. Study design a registered dietitian delivered a behavioural programme using skype for business in 10 sessions over 6 months. Participants joined the groups from any internet-connected device with a webcam. Participant perspectives were audiorecorded in one-to-one, semi-structured interviews. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed using self-determination theory as a theoretical framework. Results ten themes were identified, three relating to service engagement and seven relating to behaviour change facilitation. Key themes in engagement included 'reduced burden', described as saving time and travel and 'reduced threat' as participants perceived joining a group from home as less daunting compared to attending in-person. Despite reporting some initial technical difficulties with establishing video and audio connection, participants described beneficial peer support although not physically with other group members. Conclusion accessing a group weight management programme via videoconference may be the preferred option for some participants, overcoming some of the barriers to access to standard in-person programmes, particularly in rural areas.

Completion of an agreed personalised asthma action plan is integral to implementation of this care, and traditionally this requires a face-to-face consultation. We aimed to assess the practical feasibility and potential utility of using screen-sharing technologies to complete asthma action plans remotely. Assisted by people with diverse technological ability and using a range of devices, we tested the technological feasibility of completing action plans in remote consultations using two leading video-conference systems. We used a semi-structured topic guide to check functionality and lead feedback discussions. Themes were interpreted using the model for assessment of telemedicine applications (mast). Discussions with ten participants (age 20-74 years) revealed that screen-sharing was practical on most devices. Joint editing of an action plan (as was possible with zoom) was considered to encourage participation and improve communication. Attend anywhere had less functionality than zoom, but the nhs badging was reassuring. Most participants appreciated the screen-sharing and considered it enabled a meaningful discussion about their action plan. Online shared completion of action plans is feasible with only a few (potentially remediable) practical problems. These findings suggest this may be a fruitful approach for further study-made more urgent by the imperative to develop remote consultations in the face of a global pandemic.","English",NA,"30",1

This is due to both to the reallocation of resources toward covid-19 patients as well as concern for the risk of nosocomial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) exposure. The interruption of routine care is especially problematic for patients with chronic conditions requiring regular follow-up, such as lung transplant (ltx) recipients. Introduction: new methods such as telemedicine are needed to bridge the gap in follow-up care caused by the pandemic. Materials and methods: a retrospective analysis of video consultations (vcs) in comparison with on-site visits (osvs) was performed during a 6-week period in an ltx center in germany. Vc included a structured work-up questionnaire and vital sign documentation. Results: during the 6-week study period, 75 vcs were performed for 53 patients and 75 osvs by 51 patients occurred. By the end of our study period, 77% of physician-patient contacts occurred through vc. Physician-patient consultations were reduced by 47% compared with the equivalent time frame in 2019. In 62% of cases, vc resulted in a concrete clinical decision. One covid-19 patient in home quarantine was admitted due to respiratory failure detected by vc. Patient satisfaction with vc was high. Discussion: implementation of vc helped to reduce the need for osv and thus the risk of sars-cov-2 exposure in our patient cohort. This technology can be adopted to provide care for a wide range of chronic illnesses. Conclusions: vc can preserve access to specialist care while reducing sars-cov-2 exposure for patients with chronic illnesses during the pandemic.","English","telemedicine; web-based; home health monitoring; pandemic; infectious and disease",NA,1

It has not been consistently explored on an acute care surgery service as a method of increasing clinic availability and efficiency within a safety-net hospital system. Socioeconomic hardships associated with an in-person clinic visit can deter patients with limited resources. A virtual clinic for post-operative laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients was developed. We hypothesized that a virtual follow-up increases clinic efficiency and availability for new patients without compromising patient safety. Methods a retrospective review of patient and clinic outcomes before and after implementing virtual post-op visits for uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients on an acute care surgery service was performed. Providers called post-operative patients using a standardized questionnaire. Data included outpatient clinic composition (new vs. post-operative patients), elective operations scheduled, emergency department visits, and loss to follow-up rates. Results february to march 2017 was the baseline pre-intervention period, while february to march 2019 was post-intervention. Pre-intervention clinics consisted of 17% new and 50% post-op visits, in comparison to 31% new and 27% post-op visits in the post-intervention group (p < 0.01). Elective operations scheduled increased slightly from 8.4 to 11.5 per 100 patient visits, but was not statistically significant (p = 0.09). There was no change in the number of post-operative patients returning to the emergency department (p = 0.91) or loss to follow-up (p = 0.30) rates. Conclusions through the implementation of virtual post-operative visits for laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients, clinic efficiency improved by increasing new patient encounters, decreasing post-operative volume, and trending towards increased operations scheduled. This change did not compromise patient safety. Further implementation of telemedicine on an acute care surgery service is a promising method to expand services offered to an at-risk population and increase efficiency in a resource-limited environment.","English","Telemedicine; Virtual visit; Acute care surgery; Post-operative; and Efficiency; Safety",NA,1

To date, treatment to protocol has relied on standard face-to-face delivery. Face-to-face therapy is subject to geographic, temporal and human factors, rendering it particularly susceptible to inequities and disruption. This has resulted in poorer service provision for rural and regional families, and recently a significant challenge to providing face-to-face services during the covid-19 global pandemic. The present study examines whether fbt for an can be successfully translated to a digital delivery platform to address these access issues. Method forty young people aged 12 to 18 years who meet dsm-5 diagnostic criteria for an, and live in a rural or regional setting, will along with their family be recruited to the study. Trained therapists will provide 18 sessions of fbt over 9 months via telemedicine to the home of the young person and their family. The analysis will examine treatment effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness. Discussion the study addresses the treatment needs of families not able to attend face-to-face clinical services for evidence-based treatment for eating disorders. This might be due to several barriers, including a lack of local services or long travel distances to services. There has been a recent and unprecedented demand for telemedicine to facilitate the continuity of care during covid-19 despite geographical circumstances. If delivering treatment in this modality is clinically and economically effective and feasible, it will facilitate access to potentially lifesaving, evidence-based treatments for families formerly unable to access such care and provide evidence for the continuity of services when and where face-to-face treatment is not feasible.","English","Anorexia nervosa; Cost-consequence analysis; Inequalities; Eating and disorder; Covid-19; Young people; Telemedicine; Telemedicine; and Family-based treatment; Rural health","8",1

Rural areas in particular exhibit a rapidly aging population, with an increase in associated health issues, whereas the level of attraction for working in those regions is decreasing for young physicians. Integrating telemedical approaches in treating patients can help lessen the professional workload and counteract the trend toward the spatial undersupply in many countries. As a result, an increasing number of patients are being confronted with digital treatment and new forms of care delivery. These novel ways of care engender interactions with patients and their private lives in unprecedented ways, calling for studies that incorporate patient needs, expectations, and behavior into the design and application of telemedical technology within the field of primary care. Objective: this study aims to unveil and compare the acceptance-promoting factors of patients without (preusers) and with experiences (actual users) in using vc in a primary care setting and to provide implications for the design, theory, and use of vc. Methods: in total, 20 semistructured interviews were conducted with patients in 2 rural primary care practices to identify and analyze patient needs, perceptions, and experiences that facilitate the acceptance of vc technology and adoption behavior. Both preusers and actual users of vc were engaged, allowing for an empirical comparison. For data analysis, a procedure was followed based on open, axial, and selective coding. Results: the study delivers factors and respective subdimensions that foster the perceptions of patients toward vc in rural primary care. Factors cover attitudes and expectations toward the use of vc, the patient-physician relationship and its impact on technology assessment and use, patients' rights and obligations that emerge with the introduction of vc in primary care, and the influence of social norms on the use of vc and vice versa. With regard to these factors, the results indicate differences between preusers and actual users of vc, which imply ways of designing and implementing vc concerning the respective user group. Actual users attach higher importance to the perceived benefits of vc and their responsibility to use it appropriately, which might be rooted in the technological intervention they experienced. On the contrary, preusers valued the opinions and expectations of their peers. Conclusions: the way the limitations and potential of vc are perceived varies across patients. When practicing vc in primary care, different aspects should be considered when dealing with preusers, such as maintaining a physical interaction with the physician or incorporating social cues. Once the digital intervention takes place, patients tend to value benefits such as flexibility and effectiveness over potential concerns.","English","video consultation; technology acceptance; digital health care and technology; primary care; rural areas; telemedicine; behavioral and intention; eHealth; teleconsultation; electronic consultation; general and practitioners","8",1

The development of this type of service has been controversial, particularly in the united kingdom, but there has been little formal published evaluation of these services in any country. This paper outlines the main controversies about the use of privately provided video consultation services for primary care and shows how they are informed by the limited evaluations that have been conducted, particularly the evaluation of bgpah. This paper describes the advantages of these services in terms of convenience, speed of access, the ability to consult without traveling or face-to-face patient-doctor contact, and the possibility of recruiting doctors who cannot work in conventional settings or do not live near the patients. It also highlights the concerns and uncertainties about quality and safety, demand, fragmentation of care, impact on other health services, efficiency, and equity. There are questions about whether private primary care services based on video consultations have a sustainable business model and whether they will undermine other health care providers. During the recent covid-19 pandemic, the use of video consulting has become more widespread within conventional primary care services, and this is likely to have lasting consequences for the future delivery of primary care. It is important to understand the extent to which lessons from the evaluation of bgpah and other private services based on a video first model are relevant to the use of video consulting within conventional general practices, and to consider the advantages and disadvantages of these developments, before video consultation-based services in primary care become more widely established.","English","remote consultation; primary health care; general practice; delivery of and health care; access to health care; mobile phone","22",1

In this study, we explore utilization of and physician perspectives on this approach in an attempt to identify patient populations that may benefit most from virtual care. Methods and materials: this is a mixed-methods study with a convergent design. Approximately 6 to 8 weeks after implementation of telemedicine, all radiation oncologists in a single academic radiation oncology department were invited to participate in either semistructured interviews with embedded survey questions or a concurrently administered survey only. Rapid qualitative analysis was used to identify common themes, and quantitative data was assessed using descriptive statistics and univariable analyses. Results: at the apex of the pandemic, 92% of radiation oncology visits were conducted via telemedicine. In total, 51 of 61 radiation oncologists participated in the study (response rate 84%). Most (71%) reported no difference in ability to treat cancer appropriately via telemedicine, which was more common among specialized physicians (p z .01) but not those with higher visit volume or years of experience. Over half (55%) perceived no difference or even improvement in overall visit quality with telemedicine. Virtual visits were deemed acceptable for a median of 70% to 96% of patients, which varied by disease site. Need for physical examination, and availability of an acceptable proxy, factored into telemedicine acceptability. Most (88%) found telemedicine better than expected, but opinions were split on how telemedicine would affect physician burnout. Almost all (96%) foresaw a role for telemedicine beyond the pandemic and would opt for a median of 50% (interquartile range 20%-66%) of visits conducted via telemedicine. Conclusions: among radiation oncologists in an academic setting, telemedicine was perceived to be highly appropriate and acceptable for most patients. Future studies should focus on identifying the 5% to 30% of patients whose care may be optimized with in-person visits, and if there is alignment with patient preferences. (C) 2020 elsevier inc.

Diabetes is associated with increased mortality and cost. Therefore, we investigated the impact of increasing access to diabetes care through telemedicine. Methods five rural communities were connected via videoconference. Patients received diabetes consultation (dc) or diabetes self-management education (dsme). Dc was performed by an endocrinologist, while dsme was delivered by a certified diabetes educator. Haemoglobin a1c (hba1c), blood pressure (bp) and lipid profile were evaluated as outcome measures. Results sixty-nine subjects (70% females, 91% caucasians) were studied, with 33 receiving dc and 36 receiving dsme. Patients were aged 56.7 +/- 9.4 and 56.5 +/- 6.7 years, respectively (p > 0.5), and had had diabetes for 11.4 +/- 10.1 and 11.7 +/- 9.2 years, respectively (p > 0.5). Both dc and dsme reduced hba1c equally: dc at baseline 9.3 +/- 1.3% compared to at 12 months 7.2 +/- 0.9% (p = 0.0002), and dsme at baseline 9.8 +/- 1.6% compared to at 12 months 8.3 +/- 1.9% (p = 0.009). There was no difference in hba1c between dc and dsme at baseline and at 12 months (p > 0.1).

Methods in this study, we described the process of converting our mfm clinic from a conventional medical treatment model to a telemedicine platform. We compared clinical productivity between the two models. Outcomes were analysed using standard statistical tests. Results we suffered three symptomatic covid-19 infections among our clinical providers and staff prior to the conversion, compared with none after the conversion. We had a significant decrease in patient visits following the conversion (53.35 visits per day versus 40.3 visits per day,p < 0.0001). However, our average daily patient visits per full-time equivalent (fte) were only marginally reduced (11.1 visit per fte versus 7.6 visits per fte,p < 0.0001), resulting in a relative decrease in adjusted work relative value units (6987 versus 5440). There was an increase in more basic follow-up ultrasound procedures, complexity (current procedural technology [cpt] code 76816 (10.7% versus 19.5%, relative risk [rr] 1.81, 95% ci 1.60-2.05,p < 0.0001)) over comprehensive follow-up ultrasound procedures, cpt code 76805 (17.2% versus 7.8%, rr 0.46, 95% ci 0.39-0.53,p < 0.0001) after conversion. Despite similar proportions of new consults, there was an increase in the proportion of follow-up visits and medical decision-making complexity evaluation and management cpt codes (e.g. 99214/99215) after the conversion (17.2% versus 24.6%, rr 1.43, 95% ci 1.26-163, p < 0.0001). There were no differences between amniocentesis procedures performed between the two time periods (0.3% versus 0.2%,p = 0.5805). Conclusion the rapid conversion of an mfm platform from convention medical treatment to telemedicine platform in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic resulted in protection of healthcare personnel and mfm patients, with only a modest decrease in clinical productivity during the initial roll-out. Due to the ongoing threat from the novel coronavirus-19, an mfm telemedicine platform is a practicable and innovative solution and merits the continued support of cms and health care administrators.","English","Telemedicine; Pregnancy; Coronavirus-19; Pandemic; COVID-19; Telehealth; and Maternal care",NA,1

Methods an ophthalmologist simultaneously performed and recorded routine rop screenings on enrolled premature infants (aged <= 30 weeks and weighing <1500 g) using the keeler digital indirect ophthalmoscope. Examinations were graded as no rop, mild, type 1 or type 2. Masked to clinical findings, another ophthalmologist reviewed and graded streamed video feed transmitted at 4096 kbps. We compared the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing rop via streamed and stored-and-forwarded video clips to the gold-standard in-person examination. Results a total of 150 examinations of individual eyes from 34 babies were included. The median postmenstrual age (pma) at delivery was 24 weeks (range 23-34 weeks), the median birth weight was 630 g (range 455-1530 g) and the median pma at examination was 37 weeks (range 31-54 weeks).

To control viral transmission, social distancing measures have been implemented all over the world, interrupting the access to routine medical care for many individuals with neurological diseases. Cognitive disorders are common in many neurological conditions, e.g., stroke, traumatic brain injury, alzheimer's disease, and other types of dementia, parkinson's disease and parkinsonian syndromes, and multiple sclerosis, and should be addressed by cognitive rehabilitation interventions. To be effective, cognitive rehabilitation programs must be intensive and prolonged over time; however, the current virus containment measures are hampering their implementation. Moreover, the reduced access to cognitive rehabilitation might worsen the relationship between the patient and the healthcare professional. Urgent measures to address issues connected to covid-19 pandemic are, therefore, needed. Remote communication technologies are increasingly regarded as potential effective options to support health care interventions, including neurorehabilitation and cognitive rehabilitation. Among them, telemedicine, virtual reality, augmented reality, and serious games could be in the forefront of these efforts. We will briefly review current evidence-based recommendations on the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation and offer a perspective on the role of tele- and virtual rehabilitation to achieve adequate cognitive stimulation in the era of social distancing related to covid-19 pandemic. In particular, we will discuss issues related to their diffusion and propose a roadmap to address them. Methodological and technological improvements might lead to a paradigm shift to promote the delivery of cognitive rehabilitation to people with reduced mobility and in remote regions.","English","augmented reality; cognitive; COVID-19; rehabilitation; telemedicine; and virtual reality","11",1

The aim of this study was to successfully implement a telehealth support system for cbr workers, evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention's implementation among cbr workers in the cbr setting, and further identify strategies to address the deficit of skilled rehabilitation workers in lmic through technological intervention. Methods this pilot study included cbr workers and cbr managers to inform feasibility, acceptability, and sustainable implementation. The re-aim and dynamic sustainability framework were incorporated to guide procedural design, survey development, data collection, data evaluation, and increase success of telehealth implementation. Cbr workers participate in trainings, telehealth sessions, surveys and focus groups to inform feasibility and acceptability. Cbr managers participated in focus groups to inform feasibility and sustainable implementation. Nvivo 12 software was utilized to develop themes from cbr worker and cbr manager responses. Results findings from this study demonstrate the need for additional training support for cbr workers in cbr settings throughout the entire treatment process. The telehealth system demonstrated successful short-term implementation across several domains of feasibility. Telehealth utilization was also proven acceptable, appropriate and necessary. Cultural beliefs, cbr worker training, and cbr center infrastructure pose the most significant barriers to implementation of telehealth technologies in cbr centers. Cbr workers and managers confirmed the demand for future telehealth-based support systems, strengthening effort towards sustainability and scale-up. Conclusions telehealth can be utilized to support cbr workers that serve vulnerable and marginalized populations, and in turn improve the global health status among refugee populations by reducing inequitable access to quality health care.

Senior authors realised that in lockdown there was only one option to see a patient: virtual consultation via telecommunication technologies. This paper will discuss the current benefits and considerations of telemedicine, particularly in plastic surgery, to decipher the next route of action to further validate its use for future implementation. Method a detailed literature review was carried out comparing papers from 1992 to 2020. A survey of 122 consultant plastic surgeons found an encouraging result as 70% positively embraced the suggestion of telemedicine in their current practice. Discussion telemedicine produced equal or improved patient satisfaction. Its utilisation reduced cost for patient, clinic and consultant. With accessibility to a large percentage of the population, telemedicine enables infection control and adherence to social distancing during covid-19. Considerations include dependability on internet access, legal aspects, cyber security and general data protection regulation (gdpr), the inability to perform palpation or physical inspection and psychological impacts on the patient. Conclusion in modern times, telemedicine has become more accessible and covid-19 has made it more applicable than ever before.

Problem-solving skills were needed to continue the level of woc nursing services expected by patients, families, and professional colleagues, while reducing the hours we were physically present at our clinical facility. In order to respond to these demands, our team realized it must create an innovative approach to provide efficient, cost-effective consultations during this global crisis. This challenges in practice article summarizes our experience with use of telemedicine technologies to perform remote consultations within the acute care setting. Cases: case 1 was a 52-year-old woman with a history of paraplegia. She had several pressure injuries but had not received topical care for these wounds prior to admission. A consultation for the woc nurse was requested and performed via telehealth services on a day our team was working off-site. This case illustrates the process our team used to perform a virtual consultation and demonstrates how the use of images placed in the electronic medical record aided in developing an effective plan of care. Case 2 was a 48-year-old man who tested positive for covid-19. He developed bilateral unstageable pressure injuries on his cheeks after being placed in the prone position for a prolonged period while critically ill. This case describes multiple technologic platforms used for telemedicine consults in a patient with covid-19 requiring isolation. Conclusions: remote consultation by woc nurses was possible in our healthcare system because of previous experience using telemedicine technology and well-established collaborative relationships with providers and bedside nurses. By expanding our use of telemedicine technology, we were able to provide ongoing care to a patient without covid-19 who had woc consultation needs, and a patient with strict isolation demands due to covid-19.","English","Remote wound consultation; Telehealth; Telemedicine; Virtual wound care","47",1

However, it is unclear whether they can be utilized effectively in patients with pediatric spinal deformity (psd). Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and patient satisfaction associated with virtual visit (vv) utilization in psd patients in comparison to general pediatric orthopaedic indications. Methods: of the 482 vvs offered to pediatric orthopaedic patients at a large academic health care system between january 1, 2017, and december 31, 2018, a total of 189 vvs conducted by board-certified orthopaedic surgeons were included in the final analysis. Patient satisfaction scores were collected at the end of each vv by patient and parent rankings of the surgeon and the telemedicine service. Data on patients, visits, and connectivity sessions characteristics were collected and statistically compared between psd visits (n=33) versus those conducted for general pediatric orthopaedic indications (n=156). Results: although psd patients were older (15 +/- 3.7 vs. 12 +/- 4.7 y;p<0.01), mostly female (76% vs. 47%,p=0.003), and had longer vvs (8 +/- 4.6 vs. 5 +/- 3.6 min;p=0.003) versus their general pediatric orthopaedic counterparts, they demonstrated similarly high satisfaction scores for surgeon performance (5 +/- 0 vs. 4.8 +/- 0.1 points;p=0.08) and overall satisfaction (3 +/- 2.4 vs. 3.5 +/- 2.1;p=0.23). Approximately 80% of all vvs were conducted over mobile devices. Wait time was substantially less for psd vvs relative to subsequent office visits (13 +/- 10 vs. 41 +/- 30 min;p<0.001). Conclusions: our analysis found that telemedicine vvs provided a convenient alternative to traditional in-office visits for psd patients. Specifically, we found that psd patients received faster care with comparable satisfaction. The findings of our present analysis should encourage health care systems to continually evaluate and implement telehealth platforms to improve both the accessibility and appropriate quality of care.","English","telemedicine; pediatric spinal deformity (PSD); virtual visit (VV); and patient satisfaction; wait times","40",1

In particular, this paper presents livemicro, a system whose benefit is twofold: on one hand, it enables edge computing driven digital pathology computations, such as data-driven image processing on a live capture of the microscope. On the other hand, our system allows remote pathologists to diagnosis in collaboration in a single virtual microscope session, facilitating continuous medical education and remote consultation, crucial for under-served and remote hospital or private practice. Our results show the benefits and the principles underpinning our solution, with particular emphasis on how the pathologists interact with our application.

We discuss a less common presentation of covid-19 in a patient where the use of telemedicine technology prevented the exposure of the healthcare team in an academic general pediatrics clinic. A medically complex 20-year-old male presented via virtual visit for unilateral eye redness and discharge. He received topical ophthalmic antibiotics for presumed acute bacterial conjunctivitis and was counseled on return precautions. Three days later, the patient developed shortness of breath, fever to 102.6 degrees f, and chest pain. Covid-19 testing returned positive. Conjunctivitis is a presenting symptom in 32% of covid-19 cases. Current evidence suggests that these patients may transmit their illness at the time of presentation. Using telehealth, we avoided exposure to a covid-19-positive patient who would not have met criteria for testing or droplet precautions. Telehealth allows providers to triage patients, identifying those who need to be seen in person, thereby minimizing exposure. Transitioning toward virtual practice, particularly during a pandemic, prepares for the possibility of healthcare workers being quarantined but still able to provide care and minimizes exposure to asymptomatic patients or those with atypical symptoms.

Objective to evaluate clinical effectiveness of a brief, aging service-integrated, videoconferenced behavioral activation (tele-ba) treatment delivered by lay counselors compared with videoconferenced problem-solving therapy (tele-pst) delivered by licensed clinicians and attention control (ac; telephone support calls). Design, setting, and participants this 3-group randomized clinical trial using a randomization prior to consent approach included individuals aged 50 years or older who were homebound and had 24-item hamilton depression rating scale (hamd) scores of 15 or greater between february 15, 2016, and april 15, 2019. Tele-ba and tele-pst participants received 5 weekly treatment sessions. Assessments were performed at baseline and 12, 24, and 36 weeks after baseline. Intention-to-treat statistical analyses were performed from january 1, 2020, to february 15, 2020. Interventions tele-ba participants were taught 5 steps for reinforcing healthy behaviors to improve mood, physical functioning, and social engagement. Tele-pst participants were taught a 7-step approach for problem solving coping skills. Main outcomes and measures the primary outcome was the 24-item hamd scores. Response (ie, >= 50% reduction in hamd) and remission (ie, hamd <10) rates and effect sizes for clinically meaningful differences were examined. Secondary outcomes were disability, social engagement and activity frequency, and satisfaction with participation in social roles. Results a total of 277 participants were enrolled, including 193 (69.7%) women, 83 (30.0%) who were black, 81 (29.2%) who were hispanic, and 255 (92.1%) with income of $35000 or less. The mean (sd) age was 67.5 (8.9) years. Among these, 90 participants were randomized to tele-ba, 93 participants were randomized to tele-pst, and 94 participants were randomized to the ac. Compared with participants in the ac group, participants in the tele-ba and tele-pst groups had significantly higher response and remission rates and medium to large effect sizes (tele-ba: raw growth modeling analysis d = 0.62 [95% ci, 0.35 to 0.89]; p < .001; tele-pst: raw growth modeling analysis d = 1.00 [95% ci, 0.73 to 1.26]; p < .001) for hamd scores. While tele-pst was significantly more effective than tele-ba for reducing hamd scores (t(258) = -2.79; p = .006), there was no difference between tele-ba and tele-pst on secondary outcomes. Conclusions and relevance in this randomized clinical trial, participants who received tele-ba by lay counselors achieved statistically and clinically meaningful changes in depressive symptoms. Given shortages of licensed mental health clinicians, tele- and lay counselor-delivered services may help improve access to evidence-based depression treatment for large numbers of underserved older adults. Question is tele-delivered behavioral activation (tele-ba) treatment by bachelor's-level lay counselors for older adults who are depressed and homebound with low income clinically effective? Findings in this randomized clinical trial with 277 participants, tele-ba by lay counselors and tele-delivered problem-solving therapy by licensed clinicians were significantly more effective than telephone support calls in improving depressive symptoms, disability, social engagement and activities, and satisfaction with participation in social roles. Tele-ba was significantly less effective than tele-delivered problem-solving therapy in reducing depressive symptoms, but there were no differences in other outcomes.

Protocol for the peak randomised controlled trial","Bmc musculoskeletal disorders","2020","10.1186/s12891-020-03523-8","Background: knee osteoarthritis (oa) is a global problem that causes significant pain and physical dysfunction, substantially impacting on quality of life and imposing enormous cost to the healthcare system. Exercise is pivotal to oa management, yet uptake by people with knee oa is inadequate. Limited access to appropriately skilled health professionals, such as physiotherapists, for prescription of an exercise program and support with exercise is a major barrier to optimal care. Internet-enabled video consultations permit widespread reach. However, services offering video consultations with physiotherapists for musculoskeletal conditions are scant in australia where there is typically no government or private health insurer funding for such services. The paucity of robust evidence demonstrating video consultations with physiotherapists are clinically effective, safe and cost-effective for knee oa is hampering implementation of, and willingness of healthcare policymakers to pay for, these services. Methods: this is an assessor- and participant-blinded, two-arm, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness non-inferiority randomised controlled trial (rct) conducted in australia. We are recruiting 394 people from the community with chronic knee pain consistent with a clinical diagnosis of knee oa. Participants are randomly allocated to receive physiotherapy care via i) video-conferencing or; ii) face-to-face consultations. Participants are provided five consultations (30-45 min each) with a physiotherapist over 3 months for prescription of a home-based strengthening exercise program (to be conducted independently at home) and physical activity plan, as well as oa education. Participants in both groups are provided with educational booklets and simple exercise equipment via post. The co-primary outcomes are change in self-reported i) knee pain on walking; and ii) physical function, with a primary end-point of 3 months and a secondary end-point of 9 months. Secondary outcomes include changes in other clinical outcomes (health-related quality of life; therapeutic relationship; global ratings of change; satisfaction with care; self-efficacy; physical activity levels), time and financial costs of attending consultations, healthcare usage and convenience. Non-inferiority will be assessed using the per-protocol dataset. Discussion: findings will determine if video consultations with physiotherapists are non-inferior to traditional face-to-face consultations for management of people with knee oa.","English","Osteoarthritis; OA; Knee; Telehealth; Telerehabilitation; and Rehabilitation; Physiotherapy; Clinical trial; RCT; Musculoskeletal; and Pain; Exercise; Physical activity; Non-inferiority","21",1

A further aim was to investigate predictors for pain and pain treatment. Method: this was a register-based, quasi-experimental study based on data from the swedish registry of ulcer treatment (rut). A total of 100 patients with hard-to-heal ulcers diagnosed via video consultation were compared with 1888 patients diagnosed in person with regard to pain assessment, intensity and treatment. Ulcer pain intensity was assessed by the visual analogue scale (vas). Normally distributed variables (age, vas) were compared between consultation groups using student's t-test. Non-normally distributed variables (ulcer size, ulcer duration) were compared using the mann-whitney u-test, except for healing time, which was analysed with a log-rank test. Categorical variables (gender, ulcer aetiology and prescribed analgesics) were compared using pearson's chi-square test (chi(2)). A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Predictors for pain and pain treatment were analysed in multiple regression analyses. Results: the results showed a high presence of pain; 71% of patients with pain reported severe ulcer pain. There was no significant difference in ability to assess pain by vas in the group diagnosed via video consultation (90%) compared with the group diagnosed in person (86%) (chi(2), p=0.233). A significantly higher amount of prescribed analgesics was found for patients diagnosed via video (84%) compared with patients diagnosed by in-person assessment (68%) (chi(2), p=0.044). Predictors for high-intensity pain were female gender or ulcers due to inflammatory vessel disease, while the predictors for receiving analgesics were older age, longer healing time and being diagnosed via video consultation. Conclusion: to identify, assess and treat ulcer pain is equally possible via video as by in-person consultation. The results of this study confirm that patients with hard-to-heal ulcers suffer from high-intensity ulcer pain, with a discrepancy between pain and pain relief.

Despite this, video consultations (vcs) have not been frequently used in colorectal practice. We assessed outcomes, including the economic and environmental impact, of a vc clinic for new colorectal referrals. Method this was a prospective observational study. Fifty consecutive patients attending a vc colorectal appointment were reviewed between march 2019 and february 2020. Face-to-face appointments during the same time period were also assessed. The distance, time, cost and carbon emissions of journeys were estimated using web-based resources. Estimated loss of earnings used data from the office for national statistics. The subsequent management plans were also recorded. Results of 50 patients using vc, 40 used home devices and 10 used equipment in their local medical facility. Three patients had difficulties with the technology and converted to telephone review. Failure to attend vc appointments was less than for face-to-face appointments (4%vs6.1%). Vc appointments saved 6685 miles of travel (range 2-364 miles), 148 h travelling time and 1767 pound costs. Additional savings for loss of earnings were approximately 33.56 pound per patient. The carbon emissions saved was 4659 lb co(2)equivalent, corresponding to over 250 000 charges of a smartphone. Conclusion the use of vc resulted in significant savings related to travel and reduced time and costs for patients who chose to use the service, in addition to the environmental benefits. In this current climate vc clinics have a central role in outpatient care for both new patients and follow-ups.","English","telehealth; telemedicine; colorectal; patient consultations; clinic; and video consultaion","22",1

Nationwide telemedicine programs in cabo verde and albania have been built by the international virtual e-hospital foundation (iveh) and based on the effective initiate-build-operate-transfer (ibot) strategy. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical results between the two programs and examine the relationship between the clinical teleconsultations as an indicator of health care system needs and the contribution of local telemedicine champions. Methods:data were prospectively collected between 2014 and 2018 from albania and cabo verde. Telemedicine champions were defined as programs, physicians, or hospitals who have contributed at least 100 telemedicine consultations during the study periods. Chi-squared test was utilized to analyze the data. Results:there were 2,442 teleconsultations in cabo verde and 2,724 teleconsultations in albania during the study periods. Using the 100-consultation benchmark as the indicator of telemedicine champion, we identified radiology (n = 1,061), neurotrauma (n = 742), and general neurology or stroke (n = 489) as champion clinical disciplines in albania. With the same method of 100 consultations, we identified eight champion clinical disciplines in cabo verde, including neurology (n = 720), cardiology (n = 313), orthopedics (n = 190), surgery (143), endocrinology (141), otolaryngology (n = 139), urology (n = 139), and dermatology (126). The patient transfer/nontransfer ratio was 0.5 in cabo verde and 0.3 in albania (p < 0.001). Three hospitals in albania and eight community hospitals/health care centers in cabo verde requested the majority of teleconsultations. Two main hospitals in cabo verde and albania responded to the consultations. Conclusion:the successful implementation of a telemedicine program depends on many factors. However, physician champions, who eventually create clinical discipline champions, and represent the hospital champions, are the backbone of the sustainability and progress of any telemedicine program. The number of consultations reflects the lack of local specialty expertise to provide health care service and thus can be used for future planning and investment.","English","telemedicine; e-Health; Cabo Verde; Albania; access-to-care; health care and needs; telemedicine champion",NA,1

The provision of bariatric care across the state is difficult as most major hospitals are concentrated in the capital city of brisbane. We implemented a state-wide telehealth service to improve access for rural patients in a public bariatric service. We report our early experiences with this service. Methods we reviewed all patients seen in the bariatric telehealth clinic from 2017 to 2019. Patients underwent consultation through video-link software at their local hospital with the multidisciplinary team in brisbane (surgeon, dietician and clinical nurse). Distances from brisbane and number of visits were calculated. Telehealth patients were contacted by phone to complete a survey regarding their experiences. This was a 17-question likert-style survey with scores from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Results a total of 85 new patients underwent their initial consultation via telehealth. Each patient had a variable number of in-person as well as telehealth consultations both before and after surgery. Mean distance from telehealth consultation site to brisbane was 614 km (range 149-2472 km). In total, 41 (48%) completed the survey. With regard to telehealth saving time and money, improving access to bariatric care, and desire to use telehealth again, the mean score was 4 out of 5 or higher for all questions (i.e., agree or strongly agree). There was no identifiable post-operative complication that was caused or exacerbated by telehealth. Conclusion bariatric surgical telehealth appointments are feasible and preferred by most patients residing in rural and remote locations. Each consultation avoids significant travel time and cost for the patient and health service, with no obvious adverse outcomes.

Video based mental health care demonstrates comparable effectiveness to face-to-face treatments and is a promising mode for delivering specialized care within primary care. Nevertheless, professionals struggle with implementing video consultations in their daily practice. Specifically, little is known about mental health specialists' acceptance of mental health video consultations in routine practice. The provide (improving cross-sectoral collaboration between primary and psychosocial care: an implementation study on video consultations) project aims to improve cross-sectoral collaboration between primary and psychosocial care through implementing video consultations in primary care. To increase the uptake of video consultations, it is crucial to account for necessary prerequisites and to tailor interventions to the needs of the target group prior to implementation. Objective: the aim of this study was to explore the acceptance of video consultations embedded in primary care from the perspectives of mental health specialists in germany. Methods: we conducted a qualitative, exploratory, preimplementation study in urban and rum! Counties. We conducted three semistructured focus groups with 11 mental health specialists. We used qualitative content analysis combining an inductive-deductive approach, applying the tailored implementation in chronic diseases (ticd) framework to the text material, which comprises individual health professional factors; patient factors; professional interactions; incentives and resources; capacity for organizational change; social, political, and legal factors; and guideline factors. Results: against the background of long waiting times and a shortage of mental health specialists, especially in rural areas, participants valued video consultations as a potential means to improve access to mental health care. With respect to the ticd framework domains, the participants most often discussed individual health professional factors, followed by patient factors. All participants highlighted the importance of a trusting relationship between the patient and the therapist and doubted whether such a relationship could be established through video consultations (11/11, 100%). However, participants considered mental health specialist video consultations to be particularly suited for patients in rural areas, those with impaired mobility, and those who may otherwise remain untreated (6/11, 55%). Most participants expected video consultations to help the aforementioned patient groups avoid tedious searching for an available therapist and save on travel time and, therefore, improve access to specialized care for patients (7/11, 64%). Moreover, the participants expected video consultations to improve collaboration with the family physician (6/11, 55%). Finally, participants identified organizational aspects, such as reliable scheduling, the duration of the individual consultation (9/11, 82%), and reimbursement conditions (7/11, 67%), as key drivers for the acceptance and adoption of the model. Conclusions: while mental health specialists expect video consultations to improve access to specialized care for some patients, they consistently wonder whether such consultations can establish a trusting patient-therapist relationship. When implementing video consultations, these concerns should be addressed by training providers in managing technology-based treatment settings, with extra consideration for fostering the patients' and therapists' engagement.","English","video consultations; videoconferencing; telehealth; integrated care; and mental health; health services research; qualitative study; and preimplementation","22",1

Thus, concerns about the reducing and management of covid-19 are on the rise, as there is need to provide diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and follow-ups during the pandemic. Therefore, the covid-19 pandemic has radically and quickly altered how medical practitioners provide care to patients. Medical centers are now responding to covid-19 through rapid adoption of digital tools and technologies such as telemedicine and virtual care which refer to the delivery of healthcare services digital or at a distance using information and communications technology (ict) for treatment of patients. Telemedicine is expected to deliver timely care while minimizing exposure to protect medical practitioners and patients. Accordingly, a rapid literature review was conducted, and 35 research studies published from 2019 to may 2020 were employed to provide theoretical and practical evidence on the significance of using telemedicine and virtual care for remote treatment of patients during the covid-19 pandemic. This article provides practical guide based on how to use telemedicine and virtual care during the covid-19 pandemic. This study provides implication on the potentials of consolidating virtual care solutions in the near future towards contributing to integrate digital technologies into healthcare.","English","Medical systems; Telemedicine; Virtual care; Coronavirus disease 2019; and Remote treatment; Pandemic","44",1

Video consultation is one form that enables early detection of deteriorating patients and promotion of self-efficacy in patients who are well but anxious. Abdominal pain is a common symptom presented by patients in emergency departments. These patients could benefit from video consultation, as it enables remote follow-up of patients who do not require admission and facilitates early discharge of patients from overcrowded hospitals. Objective: the study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of digital telereview in patients presenting with undifferentiated acute abdominal pain. Methods: the saved study was a prospective randomized controlled trial in which follow-up using existing telephone-based telereview (control) was compared with digital telereview (intervention). Patients with undifferentiated acute abdominal pain discharged from the emergency department observation ward were studied based on intention-to-treat. The control arm received routine, provider-scheduled telereview with missed reviews actively coordinated and rescheduled by emergency department staff. The intervention arm received access to a platform for digital telereview (asynchronous and synchronous format) that enabled patient-led appointment rescheduling. Patients were followed-up for 2 weeks for outcomes of service utilization, efficacy (compliance with their disposition plan), and safety (re-presentation for the same condition). Results: a total of 70 patients participated, with patients randomly assigned to each arm (1:1 ratio). Patients were a mean age of 40.0 (sd 13.8; range 22-71) years, predominantly female (47/70, 67%), and predominantly of chinese ethnicity (39/70, 56%). The telereview service was used by 32 patients in the control arm (32/35, 91%) and 18 patients in the intervention arm (18/35, 51%). Most patients in control (33/35, 94%; 95% ci 79.5%-99.0%) and intervention (34/35, 97%; 95% ci 83.4%-99.9%) arms were compliant with their final disposition. There was a low rate of re-presentation at 72 hours and 2 weeks for both control (72 hours: 2/35, 6%; 95% ci 1.0%-20.5%; 2 weeks: 2/35, 6%, 95% ci 1.0%-20.5%) and intervention (72 hours: 2/35, 6%; 95% ci 1.0%-20.5%; 2 weeks: 3/35, 9%, 95% ci 2.2%-24.2%) arms. There were no significant differences in safety (p>.99) and efficacy (p>.99) between the two groups. Conclusions: the application of digital telereview for the follow-up of patients with abdominal pain may be safe and effective. Future studies are needed to evaluate its cost-effectiveness and usefulness for broader clinical application.","English","digital health; teleconsultation; video consultation; telereview; and abdominal pain; primary care; emergency department","22",1

Methods: a random set of real-life video-recorded consultations collected in 2015-2016 (n = 437) was observed and compared with that of a former study in 2007-2008 (n = 533). Patients' question-asking behaviour was coded using an adapted rias protocol containing six categories: medical condition/therapeutic regimen; psychosocial; social context; lifestyle; ask for opinion doctor; practical. Gps and patients completed questionnaires about their background characteristics. Data were analysed using multi-level analysis. Results: patients asked fewer questions in 2016 than in 2007. The type of question-asking behaviour changed significantly: in particular medical questions decreased while practical questions increased. Less educated patients asked significantly more practical questions than higher educated patients. Conclusion: contrary to our expectations, patients' question-asking has decreased in 2016 compared to 2007, while the average consultation length has increased. The type of questions shifted from medical to practical, especially in less educated patients. It seems that gps' professional role has expanded over time, since patients nowadays ask their gp more non-medical questions. Practice implications: gps probably could continue facilitating patient involvement by more frequently using partnership-building and supportive communication. (c) 2020 elsevier b.v.

Methods a non randomized stepped wedge design examined 133,396 ed visits in 15 cahs that subscribe to a single teleed provider. Data were available for at least 12 months prior to teleed implementation and at least 12 months of post-implementation. Primary analyses were conducted using multinomial logistic regression models with teleed availability (indicator of post-teleed implementation period) and activation (indicator of utilization of teleed service) predicting discharge disposition adjusting for age, sex, and clinical diagnosis. Results patients for whom teleed was activated were more likely to be transferred [adjusted odds ratio (aor) = 12.04; 95% confidence interval (ci), 10.97-13.21] and more likely to be admitted to the local hospital (aor = 3.23; 95% ci, 2.84-3.67) than to be routinely discharged. This pattern was confirmed for patients presenting with chest pain, mental illness, and injury/poisoning. However, in the period following teleed implementation, patients presenting to eds after telemedicine was available, but not necessarily utilized, were less likely to be admitted to the local hospital (aor = 0.79; 95% ci, 0.76-0.82) than to be routinely discharged. Conclusions telemedicine availability in cah eds is associated with a higher likelihood of routine discharges from the ed possibly due to changes in care associated with teleed implementation. The relationship between teleed use and disposition may be related to selection in activating teleed for cases more likely to require hospital inpatient care.","English","critical access hospital (CAH); emergency service; patient discharge; and telehealth; telemedicine","36",1

Paralleling this trend is the growth in the telehealth industry, with sharp increases in the number of platforms, functionalities, and levels of integrations within both the electronic health record and other technical systems supporting health care. When a telehealth network is intended to be used across independent health care systems, an additional layer of complexity emerges. In the context of regionalized telehealth networks that are not within the same health care system, not only are technical interoperability challenges a practical barrier, but administrative, clinical, and competitive elements also quickly emerge, resulting in fragmented, siloed technologies. Objective: the study aimed to describe a statewide approach to deploying an interoperable open access telehealth network across multiple health systems. Methods: one promising solution to the abovementioned concerns is an open access telehealth network. In the field of telehealth, an open access network (oan) can be defined as a network infrastructure that can be used by health care providers without a closed or proprietary platform, specific obligatory network, or service-specific telehealth technologies. This framework for the development of an oan is grounded in practical examples of clinical programs that function in each stage of network maturity based on the experience of the south carolina telehealth alliance (scta). The scta's experience details successes and challenges in an ongoing effort to achieve an oan. The model describes an oan in stages of collaborative maturity and provides insights into the technological, clinical, and administrative implications of making the collaboration possible. Results: the four stages of an oan are defined according to operational maturity, ranging from feasibility to demonstration of implementation. Each stage is associated with infrastructure and resource requirements and technical and clinical activities. In stage 1, technical standards are agreed upon, and the clinical programs are designed to utilize compliant technologies. In stage 2, collaboration is demonstrated through technical teams working together to address barriers, whereas clinical and administrative teams share best practices. In stage 3, a functional interoperable network is demonstrated with different institutions providing service through common telehealth end points at different patient care sites. In stage 4, clinical workflows are streamlined and standardized across institutions, and economies of scale are achieved through technical and administrative innovations. Conclusions: the approach to oan development described provides a roadmap for achieving a functional telehealth network across independent health systems. The south carolina experience reveals both successes and challenges in achieving this goal.

The improved technical quality and dependability of video-mediated consultations has opened up the possibility for more widespread use. However, questions remain regarding clinical quality and safety. Video-mediated consultations are sometimes criticized for being not as good as face-to-face, but there has been little previous in-depth research on their interactional dynamics, and no agreement on what a good video consultation looks like. Objective: using conversation analysis, this study aimed to identify and analyze the communication strategies through which video-mediated consultations are accomplished and to produce recommendations for patients and clinicians to improve the communicative quality of such consultations. Methods: we conducted an in-depth analysis of the clinician-patient interaction in a sample of video-mediated consultations and a comparison sample of face-to-face consultations drawn from 4 clinical settings across 2 trusts (1 community and 1 acute care) in the uk national health service. The video dataset consisted of 37 recordings of video-mediated consultations (with diabetes, antenatal diabetes, cancer, and heart failure patients), 28 matched audio recordings of face-to-face consultations, and fieldnotes from before and after each consultation. We also conducted 37 interviews with staff and 26 interviews with patients. Using linguistic ethnography (combining analysis of communication with an appreciation of the context in which it takes place), we examined in detail how video interaction was mediated by 2 software platforms (skype and facetime). Results: patients had been selected by their clinician as appropriate for video-mediated consultation. Most consultations in our sample were technically and clinically unproblematic. However, we identified 3 interactional challenges: (1) opening the video consultation, (2) dealing with disruption to conversational flow (eg, technical issues with audio and/or video), and (3) conducting an examination operational and technological issues were the exception rather than the norm. In all but 1 case, both clinicians and patients (deliberately or intuitively) used established communication strategies to successfully negotiate these challenges. Remote physical examinations required the patient (and, in some cases, a relative) to simultaneously follow instructions and manipulate technology (eg, camera) to make it possible for the clinician to see and hear adequately. Conclusions: a remote video link alters how patients and clinicians interact and may adversely affect the flow of conversation. However, our data suggest that when such problems occur, clinicians and patients can work collaboratively to find ways to overcome them. There is potential for a limited physical examination to be undertaken remotely with some patients and in some conditions, but this appears to need complex interactional work by the patient and/or their relatives. We offer preliminary guidance for patients and clinicians on what is and is not feasible when consulting via a video link.","English","delivery of health care; physical examination; remote consultation; and telemedicine; health communication; language; nonverbal communication; and mobile phone","22",1

This is of considerable significance in saudi arabia where there is a lack of community-based rehabilitation, which renders the need of telemedicine services. There is lack of data regarding understanding, awareness, and attitudes of rehabilitation professional toward telerehabilitation. This study was aimed to explore saudi-based rehabilitation professionals' knowledge of telerehabilitation. Materials and methods: after pilot testing, a survey questionnaire was distributed to 82 rehabilitation professionals working in different regions of saudi arabia. The survey included 14 close-ended questions targeting five domains: demographics, telemedicine knowledge, telerehabilitation service knowledge, social acceptance of these services, and risks associated with these services. Descriptive statistics were obtained by analyzing data using microsoft excel. Results: in total 46% of the participants were aware of telerehabilitation service technology but did not use it. 69.51% considered both telerehabilitation and community-based rehabilitation as the best service delivery methods. About 43% of participants reported that lack of knowledge about information technology and cost were the main factors that led to their limited use of telerehabilitation systems. The majority of the participants (52.44%) considered breach of confidentiality to be a risk associated with telerehabilitation services. Conclusions: even though considerable number of the participants considered telerehabilitation as an important service delivery method, most of them are not involved in telerehabilitation.

Most research in this area is based on questionnaires and focuses on long-term conditions. The few studies that have focused on physical examinations in video consultations indicated that it poses challenges for the participants. The specific activity of wound assessment through video in postsurgery consultations has not yet been studied. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of face-to-face and video settings on the moment-to-moment organization of such an activity is original. Objective: the aim of this study was to examine the impact of video technology on the procedure of postsurgery wound assessment and its limits. Methods: we recorded 22 postoperative video consultations and 17 postoperative face-to-face consultations. The primary purpose of the consultation was to inform the patient about the final pathology results of the resected specimen, and the secondary purpose was to check on the patient's recovery, including an assessment of the closed wound. The recordings were transcribed in detail and analyzed using methods of conversation analysis. Results: the way that an assessment of the wound is established in video consultations differs from the procedure in face-to-face consultations. In the consultation room, wound assessments overwhelmingly (n=15/17) involve wound showings in the context of surgeons reporting their observations formatted with evidentials (""looks neat"") and subsequently assessing what these observations imply or what could be concluded from them. In contrast, wound assessments in video consultations do not tend to involve showing the wound (n=3/22) and, given the technological restrictions, do not involve palpation. Rather, the surgeon invites the patient to assess the wound, which opens up a sequence of patient and physician assessments where diagnostic criteria such as redness or swollenness are made explicit. In contrast to observations in regular consultations, these assessments are characterized by epistemic markers of uncertainty (""i think,"" ""sounds...good"") and evidentials are absent. Even in cases of a potential wound problem, the surgeon may rely on questioning the patient rather than requesting a showing. Conclusions: the impact of video technology on postoperative consultations is that a conclusive wound assessment is arrived at in a different way when compared to face-to-face consultations. In video consultations, physicians enquire and patients provide their own observations, which serve as the basis for the assessment. This means that, in video consultations, patients have a fundamentally different role. These talking-based assessments are effective unless, in cases of a potential problem, patient answers seem insufficient and a showing might be beneficial.","English","video consultation; remote consultation; physical examination; and assessment; patient-physician relationship; conversation analysis","22",1

More recently, innovative technology-based care models (eg, video consultations) have been proposed to facilitate access to specialist services. Against this background, the provide (improving cross-sectoral collaboration between primary and psychosocial care: an implementation study on video consultations) project aims to improve the provision of psychosocial care through implementing video consultations integrated into routine primary care. Objective: from the patients' perspective, this qualitative preimplementation study explored (1) anticipated benefits from and (2) barriers to implementing mental health specialist video consultations embedded in primary care services and (3) prerequisites for interacting with therapists via video consultations. Methods: using a purposive (ie, stratified) sampling strategy, we recruited 13 patients from primary care practices and a tertiary care hospital (psychosomatic outpatient clinic) for one-off semistructured interviews. In a computer-assisted thematic analysis, we inductively (bottom-up) derived key themes concerning the practicability of mental health specialist video consultations. To validate our results, we discussed our findings with the interviewees as part of a systematic member checking. Results: overall, we derived 3 key themes and 10 subthemes. Participants identified specific benefits in 2 areas: the accessibility of mental health specialist care (shorter waiting times: 11/13, 85%; lower threshold for seeking specialist mental health care: 6/13, 46%; shorter travel distances: 3/13, 23%); and the environment in primary care (familiar travel modalities, premises, and employees: 5/13, 38%). The main barriers to the implementation of mental health video consultations from the patients' perspective were the lack of face-to-face contact (13/13, 100%) and technical challenges (12/13, 92%). Notably, participants' prerequisites for interacting with therapists (12/13, 92%) did not seem to differ much from those concerning face-to-face contacts. Conclusions: mental health service users mostly welcomed mental health specialist video consultations in primary care. Taking a pragmatic stance, service users, who are often frustrated about uncoordinated care, particularly valued the embedment of the consultations in the familiar environment of the primary care practice. With respect to interventional studies and implementation, our findings underscore the need to minimize technical disruptions during video consultations and to ensure optimal resemblance to face-to-face settings (eg, by training therapists in consistently reacting to nonverbal cues).","English","telemedicine; remote consultation; implementation; primary health care; and mental health services; thematic analysis; integrated behavioral health; and health services research","22",1

We encountered an unanticipated access gap for in-person dermatology consultations in our tertiary care hospital that routinely cares for complex high acuity patients with multiple comorbidities. To bridge this gap in specialist expertise in a timely manner, we expeditiously designed and implemented a telemedicine-supported inpatient dermatology consultation service. Methods: we conducted a retrospective review of 155 tele-dermatology consultations conducted between november 2017 and march 2019 as well as periodic prospective multidisciplinary process improvement meetings to optimize service-associated process maps and workflows. Results: tele-dermatology consultations changed the working diagnosis of the primary team in 52.3% of cases and most commonly recommended medical management (61.9% of cases). In total 100% of patients accepted telemedicine support and rated their experience as positive. The first three periodic process improvement meetings led to significant improvements in tele-dermatology-related process maps and workflows. Discussion: diagnostic concordance rates between the primary team and the tele-dermatologist were similar to those reported in the literature for in-person dermatology consultations. Important process improvements include establishing central responsibility of preparing and overseeing the consultation process, mandating the presence of a primary team representative during consultation and patient chart review by the tele-dermatologist before tele-consultation.

Delivering valuable healthcare in underserved areas can be achieved through the employment of new technical innovations, such as telemedicine, which improves service delivery processes. Accordingly, this paper discusses how telemedicine strategies have enhanced the sustainability of right of ""access to healthcare"" in rural areas.

This study addresses these challenges by developing photocaremd, a store-and-forward (saf) teledermatology consultation workflow built entirely within an existing epic-based ehr. Methods thirty-six primary care physicians (pcps) from eight outpatient clinics submitted 215 electronic consults (econsults) for 211 patients to a stanford health care dermatologist via photocaremd. Comparisons were made with in-person referrals for this same dermatologist prior to initiation of photocaremd. Results compared to traditional in-person dermatology clinic visits, econsults decreased the time to diagnosis and treatment from 23 days to 16 hours. The majority (73%) of econsults were resolved electronically. In-person referrals from photocaremd (27%) had a 50% lower cancellation rate compared with traditional referrals (11% versus 22%). The average in-person visit and documentation was 25 minutes compared with 8 minutes for an econsult. Photocaremd saved 13 additional clinic hours to be made available to the dermatologist over the course of the pilot. At four patients per hour, this opens 52 dermatology clinic slots.

Telehealth is becoming an accepted way to improve patient access to specialist healthcare. Over 200,000 australian's have hepatitis c virus (hcv) and new treatments are very effective and well tolerated. We aim to demonstrate that hcv treatment utilising telehealth support for care delivery has cure rates similar to onsite care in clinical trials. We also report length of consultation and calculate reductions in travel and carbon output. Methods patient demographic, clinical, and treatment outcome data were collected prospectively from hospital software and analysed retrospectively. This was an audit of all patients treated for hcv in one year from a single tertiary hospital that included telehealth in their care delivery. Results sustained virological response was achieved in 51/52 (98%) patients with completed treatment courses, and 51/58 (88%) of those who had a planned telehealth consultation as part of their management. A median of 634 km of patient travel was saved per telehealth consultation. Discussion we found that a telehealth-supported outreach programme for patients in regional australia with hcv produced similar outcomes to clinical trials.

Mohs micrographic surgery (mms) is a surgical modality used to treat nonmelanoma skin cancers. Objective this study evaluates the use of teledermatology for preoperative consultation for mms. Methods and materials a retrospective analysis of interfacility mms referrals to the bronx veterans affairs medical center (vamc) was conducted. The consult failure rates (cfrs), treatment follow-through rates, time to treatment, and travel savings for ""face-to-face"" preoperative consults were compared with store-and-forward ""teledermatology"" preoperative consults. Results although both ""teledermatology"" and ""face-to-face"" preoperative consults resulted in an equivalent percentage of treated lesions, teledermatology had a significantly decreased cfr.

However, little is known in terms of attitude, satisfaction and quality of care using vc over a face-to-face (f2f) consultation. The aim of this observational survey study was to compare the attitude and satisfaction with vc amongst patients suffering from colorectal cancer and their treating surgeons at the outpatient surgical care clinic in a tertiary referral centre. Methods a patient-preference model was chosen following the concept of shared decision making. A total of fifty patients with colorectal cancer were asked to choose between vc- or a f2f-contact during their follow up at the outpatient surgical care clinic and were subsequently assigned to either the vc-group or the f2f-group. Attitude and satisfaction rates of both groups and their surgeons were measured using a questionnaire administered immediately after the consultation. Results out of the 50 patients, 42% chose vc as their preferred follow-up modality. Patients demographics did not differ significantly. Patients who use video calling in their personal life choose vc significantly more often than patients lacking such experience (p = 0.010). These patients scored high on both the attitude- and satisfaction scale of the post-vc questionnaire. Patients who chose a f2f-contact seemed to question the ability of the surgeon to properly assess their healthcare condition by using a video connection more (p = 0.024). Surgeons were highly satisfied with the use of vc. Conclusions based on patient preference, vc is equivalent to a f2f consultation in terms of patient satisfaction and perceived quality of care.

Methods a pilot study of 84 morbidly obese patients undergoing either laparoscopic roux-y gastric bypass (lrygb) or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (lgs) was performed. Home monitoring consisted of daily contact via video consultation and measurement of vital signs at home. The primary outcome was feasibility of home monitoring. Secondary outcomes were complications and patient satisfaction measured with a questionnaire (psq-18). Results in 77 of the 84 patients (92%), videoconference was possible on day 1, 74 patients (88%) on day 2 and 76 patients (90%) on day 3. Four patients (5%) were never reached.

Furthermore, video-based feedback (vf) has proven to be beneficial in formative assessments. However, vf in ccs with the use of pre-recorded videos from real-life settings is less commonly studied than the use of simulated patients. To explore: 1) perceptions about the potential benefits and challenges in this kind of vf; 2) differences in the ccc scores in first-year medical residents in primary care, before and after a communication program using vf in a curricular formative assessment. Method we conducted a pre/post study with a control group. The intervention consisted of vf sessions regarding ccs, performed in a small group with peers and a facilitator. They reviewed clinical consultations pre-recorded in a primary care setting with real patients. Before and after the intervention, 54 medical residents performed two clinical examinations with simulated patients (sp), answered quantitative scales (perception of patient-centeredness and jefferson empathy scale), and semi-structured qualitative questionnaires. The performances were scored by sp (perception of patient-centeredness and care scale) and by two blind raters (spikes protocol-based and ccog-based scale). The quantitative data analysis employed repeated-measures anova. The qualitative analysis used the braun and clarke framework for thematic analysis. Results the quantitative analyses did not reveal any significant differences in the sum scores of the questionnaires, except for the jefferson empathy scale. In the qualitative questionnaires, the main potential benefits that emerged from the thematic analysis of the vf method were self-perception, peer-feedback, patient-centered approach, and incorporation of reflective practices. A challenging aspect that emerged from facilitators was the struggle to relate the vf with theoretical references and the resident's initial stress to record and watch oneself on video. Conclusion vf taken from real-life settings seems to be associated with a significant increase in self-perceived empathy. The study of other quantitative outcomes related to this vf intervention needs larger sample sizes. Vf with clinical patients from real healthcare settings appears to be an opportunity for a deeper level of self-assessment, peer-feedback, and reflective practices.","English","Communication skills; Physician; patient relationship; Primary care and education; Testing; assessment; Postgraduate training","20",1

We describe barriers, facilitators and lessons learned while implementing a system to remotely prescribe buprenorphine to veterans in rural settings. Methods: we conducted a quality improvement project aimed at increasing the availability of medications for oud (moud) to veterans. This project focused on tele-prescribing buprenorphine to rural sites via a hub (centralized prescribers) and spoke (rural clinics) model. After soliciting a wide-range of inputs from site visits, qualitative interviews of key stakeholders at rural sites, and review of preliminary cases, a ""how-to"" toolkit was developed and iteratively refined to guide tele-prescribing of buprenorphine. After internal and external facilitation strategies were employed, veterans with oud at three clinics were transitioned to buprenorphine treatment via telemedicine. Results: factors impacting adoption of the tele-prescribing intervention were mapped to the consolidated framework for implementation research (cfir) constructs. Barriers to adoption included concerns about legality of tele-prescribing a controlled substance, conflicting interests between different stakeholders, and coordination with an existing buprenorphine program requiring more attendance and abstinence from veterans than the tele-prescribing program required. Factors facilitating adoption included a sense of mission around combating the opioid epidemic, preexisting use of and comfort with tele-prescribing, and rural sites' control over veterans referred to tele-prescribers.

Findings in this nonrandomized controlled trial including 98 pregnant women with opioid use disorder, there were no statistically significant differences in rates of retention in treatment between women receiving opioid use disorder treatment via telemedicine vs in person (80.4% vs 92.7%). These findings were also apparent in newborns with neonatal abstinence syndrome (telemedicine: 45.4% vs in person: 63.2%). Meaning telemedicine may provide a scalable solution to making lifesaving treatment available to pregnant women to reduce the maternal morbidity and mortality associated with opioid use disorder and improve maternal and child health. This nonrandomized controlled trial evaluates treatment of opioid use disorder in pregnant women via telemedicine vs in-person care. Importance there are high rates of maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality associated with opioid use disorder (oud). Integrating oud treatment in obstetric practices for pregnant and postpartum women via telemedicine can increase access to care and reduce the consequences of oud. Evaluation of this care delivery model, however, is needed before widespread adoption. Objective to compare maternal and newborn outcomes among pregnant women with oud receiving care via telemedicine vs in person. Design, setting, and participants a nonrandomized controlled trial including 98 women receiving perinatal oud treatment in 4 outpatient obstetric practices by telemedicine or in person and followed up until 6 to 8 weeks post partum was conducted from september 4, 2017, to december 31, 2018. Logistic regression with propensity score adjustment was applied to reduce group selection bias and control for potentially confounding variables. Interventions participants were seen weekly for 4 weeks, every 2 weeks for 4 weeks, and monthly thereafter and provided relapse prevention therapy and buprenorphine. Main outcomes and measures the outcomes were retention in treatment, defined as uninterrupted addiction treatment during pregnancy through 6 to 8 weeks post partum; urine drug screen results at delivery and 6 to 8 weeks post partum; and a neonatal abstinence syndrome (nas) diagnosis collected via electronic health records. Results the mean (sd) age of the 98 pregnant women was 30.23 (5.12) years. Of these, 41 of 44 women (93.2%) in the telemedicine group and 48 of 54 women (88.9%) in the in-person group chose to continue treatment in the program after an initial evaluation. After propensity score weighting and doubly robust estimation, no significant differences were found between groups in retention in treatment at 6 to 8 weeks post partum (telemedicine: 80.4% vs in person: 92.7%; treatment effect, -12.2%; 95% ci, -32.3% to -4.4%). Similarly, after propensity score weighting and doubly robust estimation, there were no significant group differences in rates of nas (telemedicine: 45.4% vs in person: 63.2%; treatment effect, -17.8%; 95% ci, -41.0% to 8.9%). Conclusions and relevance in this nonrandomized controlled trial, virtually integrated oud care in obstetric practices produced similar maternal and newborn outcomes compared with in-person care. These findings may have important public health implications for combatting the opioid crisis and its consequences on pregnant women and their families. Future large randomized clinical trials are needed.","English",NA,"3",1

These challenges can limit the sample size and generalizability of the cohorts included in both natural history studies and clinical trials. Tuberous sclerosis complex (tsc) is a rare genetic syndrome that confers an elevated risk for autism spectrum disorder (asd), with social communication delays identified in this population as early as 12 months of age. Early identification of risk necessitates parallel testing of early intervention, prompting the first randomized controlled clinical trial of behavioral intervention for infants with tsc (nct03422367). However, considerable early recruitment challenges have mandated the systematic identification of enrollment barriers followed by modification of the study design to address these barriers. Methods caregivers were interviewed regarding barriers to enrollment (phase 1). Adaptations to the intervention were made to address these barriers (phase 2). Outcomes based on this modification to the study design were defined by enrollment rate and participant demographics. Results qualitative reports from caregivers indicated that distance and time were the primary barriers to clinical trial enrollment. The intervention was then modified to a remote model, with at-home, parent-delivered intervention, and weekly video conferencing with interventionists at the study sites. Enrollment increased 10-fold (from 3 to 30 participants) within 1 year and included a more diverse and clinically representative cohort of infants. Conclusion the design and implementation of more scalable methods to disseminate research remotely can substantially improve access to clinical trials in rare neurodevelopmental disorders. The lessons learned from this trial can serve as a model for future studies not only in rare conditions, but in other populations that lack adequate access, such as families with limited financial or clinical resources. Continued efforts will further refine delivery methods to enhance efficiency and ease of these delivery systems for families.","English","Telehealth; Early intervention; Tuberous sclerosis complex; Clinical and trial recruitment; Behavioral intervention; Autism spectrum disorder; and Remote delivery","12",1

Although there is growing interest in using robots in telemedicine, there are few economic evaluation studies of robot-based telemedicine. Introduction: robots developed for use in telemedicine consultation services may help address the challenges that result from korean physicians' efforts to support patients in vietnam. We perform a cost-benefit analysis to assess the economic feasibility of a robot-based telemedicine consultation system compared with traditional face-to-face outpatient services. Methods: a cost-benefit analysis is performed of a robot-based telemedicine consultation system between s hospital in korea and h hospital in vietnam. The threshold was calculated as the point at which the cost of providing telemedicine consultation equals the cost of providing the same service using traditional methods. Results: the annual cost of a robot-based telemedicine consultation system was estimated as 6,056.40 usd, whereas the annual benefit from replacing traditional outpatient services was estimated as 1,508.51 usd, resulting in a threshold point of 4.01 visits per year. Consequently, if the telemedicine consultation robot system replaces >4.01 physician visits per year, it is more economical than conventional face-to-face services. If the physician needs to stay longer, the threshold will be lower. Conclusions: as our results show, robot-based systems for telemedicine have economic value and can potentially offer a solution to the unmet health care needs among patients living in medically underdeveloped regions by providing proper and timely medical care.","English","telemedicine; e-Health; robot-based teleconsultation; economic and evaluation; cost-benefit","26",1

However, the safety of digital medical imaging in remote consultations has also attracted more and more attention from the medical industry. To ensure the integrity and security of medical images, this paper proposes a robust watermarking algorithm to authenticate and recover from the distorted medical images based on regions of interest (roi) and integer wavelet transform (iwt). First, the medical image is divided into two different parts, regions of interest and non-interest regions. Then the integrity of roi is verified using the hash algorithm, and the recovery data of the roi region is calculated at the same time. Also, binary images with the basic information of patients are processed by logistic chaotic map encryption, and then the synthetic watermark is embedded in the medical carrier image using iwt transform. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested by the simulation experiments based on the matlab program in ct images of the lungs. Experimental results show that the algorithm can precisely locate the distorted areas of an image and recover the original roi on the basis of verifying image reliability. The maximum peak signal to noise ratio (psnr) value of 51.24 has been achieved, which proves that the watermark is invisible and has strong robustness against noise, compression, and filtering attacks.","English","Digital watermarking; logistic; hash algorithm; ROI; IWT","64",1

However, the telepsychiatry group demonstrated a significantly higher rate of post-traumatic stress disorder, history of violence, ongoing legal issues, and children in outside custody. It also remained engaged in treatment longer, had fewer discharges against medical advice, and was more likely to complete treatment. Discussion/conclusions: our study highlights this telepsychiatry clinic's real-world difference serving the complex substance abuse treatment needs of alaska native individuals. It also reinforces telepsychiatry's promise in serving other communities facing a high burden of addiction and mental illness yet facing barriers to high-quality, culturally competent services.","English","behavioral health; telemedicine; policy telehealth; telepscychiatry","26",1

We assessed if teledermatology could improve primary care provider (pcp)-delivered care for cutaneous disease at a clinic serving uninsured patients. Materials and methods: utilizing the american academy of dermatology's free accessderm program, we offered store-and-forward teledermatology to pcps, who initiated consultations at will during clinical care independent of the study. We retrospectively analyzed all consultations from 2013 to 2017 and collected patient age/sex, teledermatologist diagnosis, time to teledermatologist reply, time to next dermatology appointment, as well as pcp- and teledermatologist-proposed care plans. Results: retrospective analysis of 131 consults revealed a 37-h mean teledermatology response-time versus a 14-day appointment wait (p < 0.00001). Teledermatologists provided a definitive care plan without in-person evaluation for 82 (65%) of completed consults and recommended interim treatments while awaiting appointments in 15 cases, thus accelerating care plan delivery in 97 cases (76%). The triage decision rate differed among diagnostic categories; deferral to in-person evaluation was more frequent for neoplasms (p < 0.0001). When pcps specified preconsult treatment plans, 82% differed from teledermatologist-advised management. Following teledermatologist recommendations would have changed the clinical course in 70% of cases, potentially avoiding suboptimal care, including inappropriate corticosteroids, antimicrobials, and emergency room referrals. Conclusions: we found teledermatology can effectively guide pcps in resource-limited settings by accelerating delivery of dermatologist-recommended care plans for uninsured patients. Expanding teledermatology for pcps in under-resourced clinics has the potential to improve treatment of cutaneous disease by nonspecialists and to mitigate suboptimal care for disadvantaged patients.","English","AccessDerm; clinical outreach; dermatology; health care access; health and care disparities; store-and-forward; teledermatology; telemedicine; and underserved","26",1

Introduction: this study was conducted to determine the effects of telehealth-based care delivery on clinical, temporal, and cost outcomes for behavioral health patients in rural emergency departments (eds) of four midwestern critical access hospitals (cahs). Materials and methods: observational matched cohort study of adult (age >= 18 years) behavioral health patients treated in participating cah eds from 2015 to 2017 (n = 287). Telehealth cases were matched 2:1 retrospectively to nontelehealth control cases based on gender, age 10 years, diagnosis group, and cah, before implementation of telehealth in the rural hospitals (2005-2013; n = 153). Results: the greatest number of behavioral health cases evaluated was in the mood, anxiety, and other mental health disorders category. The majority of patients in the telehealth (74%) and nontelehealth (68%) cohorts were 18-44 years. Mean ed wait time for the telehealth cohort was significantly shorter at 12 min (95% ci 11-14 min) (p < 0.001) compared to a mean time of 27 min (95% ci 22-32 min) for the nontelehealth case controls (local provider only). The ed length of stay (los) for the telehealth cohort was significantly longer (m = 318 min vs. 147min, p < 0.001) compared to the nontelehealth cohort. The end of telehealth visit to departure (eotvtd) from the ed in minutes was evaluated to highlight factors potentially influencing delivery of behavioral health care in the ed. Across three behavioral diagnostic categories, time in minutes from end of telehealth visit to disposition/discharge was significantly longer for suicide and intentional self-injury cases (n = 100; 113 min, 95% ci 88-145; p = 0.004) compared to anxiety, mood, and other mental health disorders (n = 126; 66 min, 95% ci 52-83). There was a clinically meaningful difference in eotvtd in minutes for substance abuse-related cases, which were shorter in length on average (n = 58; 71 min, 95% ci 54-94). Total ed costs for substance abuse-related cases for the telehealth (n = 58; $4556, 95% ci $3963-$5238) cohort were significantly higher than for the two other behavioral diagnostic groups (p < 0.001). Conclusions: telehealth consultation in the ed for behavioral health cases was associated with decreased wait time and longer ed los. Similar to recent studies, the most common behavioral health cases involved mood and anxiety disorders. Costs related to treatment were highest for substance abuse-related cases, likely due to the additional interventions needed, especially related to resuscitation there are opportunities to improve ed efficiencies and post-telehealth visit protocols related to the timeframe extending from the eotvtd from the ed, which continues to be a focus of future research. Additional research is also needed to determine if telehealth lends itself more effectively to specific categories of behavioral health cases.","English","telehealth; emergency department; telebehavioral health; critical access and hospital; rural health; length of stay; wait time; time-to-provider; and telemedicine","25",1

Telemedicine use is increasing in many specialties, but its impact on clinical outcomes in infectious diseases has not been systematically reviewed. We reviewed the current evidence for clinical effectiveness of telemedicine infectious diseases consultations, including outcomes of mortality, hospital readmission, antimicrobial use, cost, length of stay, adherence, and patient satisfaction. Methods. We queried ovid medline 1946-, embase.com 1947-, scopus 1823-, cochrane database of systematic reviews (cdsr), cochrane central register of controlled trials (central), and clinicaltrials.gov 1997- through august 5, 2019, for studies looking at clinical outcomes of infectious diseases in the setting of telemedicine use. We did not restrict by language or year of publication.

Bias was assessed using standard methodologies. Prospero crd42018105225. Results. From a search pool of 1154 studies, only 18 involved telemedicine infectious diseases consultation and our selected clinical outcomes. The outcomes tracked were heterogeneous, precluding meta-analysis, and the majority of studies were of poor quality. Overall, clinical outcomes with telemedicine infectious diseases consultation seem comparable to in-person infectious diseases consultation. Conclusions. Although in widespread use, the clinical effectiveness of telemedicine infectious diseases consultations has yet to be sufficiently studied.

Method data on the time and nature of all calls between 1 april 2014 and 30 march 2015 were obtained from the patient electronic records. Interviews with 13 participants captured patients and carers perspectives. Results to date, 3291 patients have been referred to the gold line. During the study period, 42% of registered patients had a non-cancer diagnosis and 45.2% of service users were not known to specialist palliative care services. The median time on the caseload was 49days (range 1-504days). 4533 telephone calls and 573 video consultations were made involving 1813 individuals. 39% of the 5106 contacts were resolved by the gold line team without referral to other services. 69% of calls were made outside normal working hours. Interviews with patients and carers reported experiences of support and reassurance from the gold line and the importance of practical advice was emphasised. Current data (year to october 2015) show that 98.5% of calls (4500/4568) resulted in patients remaining in their place of residence. Conclusions a nurse led, 24/7 telephone and video consultation service can provide valuable support for patients identified to be in the last year of life and for their carers. The line enabled them to feel supported and remain in their place of residence, hence reducing the pressure for avoidable hospital admissions and use of other services.

Methods: in this study, we performed a controlled trial (rct) on standard pap treatment (sg) as compared with proactive telemonitored pap treatment (tg). After three months and one year, pap adherence (min of use per day) and clinical outcome variables were compared. Results: in 33 (47.1%) out of 70 patients diagnosed with therapy-relevant osa [70% male, 62 (5) years, body mass index (bmi) 30 (4) kg/m(2), barthel index 90 (20), nihss 3 (3)] in-hospital pap titration was performed.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a recently implemented pediatric surgical telehealth pilot program from the family and provider perspectives. Methods enabled by an existing telehealth infrastructure for pediatric subspecialty medicine and mental health, a pilot telehealth program for surgical consultation was established by a single surgeon in british columbia. Following establishment of eligibility criteria, patients from remote communities requiring new consultation or clinical follow-up were offered a telehealth alternative. At the end of the encounter, both the parent and patient (if appropriate) provided feedback via a questionnaire. Provider satisfaction was also assessed via a questionnaire. We estimated costs avoided and analyzed data on pediatric surgery consultation wait time. Results between september 2014 and november 2017, 80 patients were seen in 19 remote telehealth centres, 23 as new referrals and 57 in follow-up consultation. Among new referrals, the commonest diagnosis was chest wall deformity. The average travel distance avoided was 705 km, with an estimated direct cost avoidance of $585. Sixty-four families (80%) completed the questionnaire. Almost all (63 [98%]) indicated high overall satisfaction with the telehealth experience. Provider satisfaction was similarly high, in terms of both the technology user interface and clinical effectiveness. Overall pediatric surgical consultation wait times were unaffected.

This study aimed to investigate the cost-utility of a home-based telerehabilitation program. Methods a comparative, trial-based, incremental cost-utility analysis was conducted from a health care provider's perspective. We collected data as part of a multi-centre, two-arm, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial with 6 months follow-up. There were 53 participants randomised to either a telerehabilitation program (consisting of 12 weeks of group-based exercise and education delivered into the home via online video-conferencing) or a traditional centre-based program.

Design and setting this was an observational study using 318 recorded gp consultations with adult patients in the uk. Method a safety-netting coding tool was applied to all consultations. Logistic regression for the presence or absence of safety-netting advice was compared between patient, clinician, and problem variables. Results a total of 390 episodes of safety-netting advice were observed in 205/318 (64.5%) consultations for 257/555 (46.3%) problems.

Depression is the most common cause of mental illness amongst older people. As a result of the growth of the older population, it is expected that an increasing number of older people will need treatment. Depression can be effectively treated-but fewer than half of those who are affected receive treatment. Barriers to receiving treatment are lack of resources and trained healthcare providers, social stigma, incorrect diagnoses and long distances to treatment facilities. There is an increased need for alternative ways of treating patients with depression. The use of video consultations has shown to be a viable option for delivering mental health care to older patients. Use of video consultations allows patients to receive treatment in their own homes. None of the existing reviews have focused on satisfaction with the use of video consultations amongst older people with depression. This paper provides knowledge regarding the use of video consultations, especially for older people with depression. What this paper adds to existing knowledge? No previous review has sought to understand the use of video consultations in mental health care to older patients with depression. The results show that video consultations support mental health practice, especially as a useful alternative when face-to-face therapy is not possible. An initial scepticism from participants quickly disappeared when video consultations were experienced in action. The challenges associated with the use of video consultations seem to consist of technical problems and lack of support from staff. What are the implications for practice? Mental health practitioners should consider the use of video consultations because it can support mental health practice, especially as a useful alternative when face-to-face therapy is not possible.

There is an increased need for alternative ways of treating patients; the use of video consultations has been shown to be a viable option for delivering mental health care. However, none of the existing reviews have focused on satisfaction with the use of video consultations amongst older people with depression and providers. Aim to conduct a systematic review of the existing literature focusing on patients' and providers' experiences of video consultations for depression. Method eight scientific databases were searched.

Objectives: to present the implementation of an outreach counseling program via videoconferencing or telephone to patients receiving care in an outpatient palliative care clinic and to compare patients using this service to those who only received psychological counseling in our outpatient clinic. Methods: we conducted a retrospective chart review of cancer patients seen for psychology counseling services in an outpatient supportive care center between june 2015 and march 2017. Results: we reviewed 2072 unique patients (52% of the total patients seen at the outpatient supportive care center), who had 4567 total counseling encounters across outreach and outpatient settings. A total of 452 (22%) patients participated in a combination of outpatient and outreach counseling services. Patients who participated in outreach services had significantly more encounters (311 [69%] had two to five sessions) compared with those who had outpatient services only (1137 [70%] had one session only) (p < .001). Outreach patients also had shorter times between the initial and follow-up encounters (median 14 days) compared with those who had outpatient services only (median 30 days) (p < .0001).

Videoconference interventions have the potential for widespread scaling, and can provide both real time interaction and flexibility in delivery times regardless of location, but there is little information on their effectiveness and acceptability. Materials and methods: this study as part of a larger weight loss trial describes the videoconference adaption of group lifestyle balance (glb) program, a community group-based diabetes prevention program intervention, and provides a comparison of weight loss and meeting attendance between in-person and videoconference delivery modes over 12 weeks in adult family members of military service members. Forty-three participants were enrolled from two military installations and received either the videoconference-adapted or an in-person glb program in a non-randomized trial design. Differences in program attendance and percent weight lost at 12 weeks were compared by independent samples t-tests and nonparametric methods. Group differences in the percentage of weight lost over the 12-week period were analyzed using a linear mixed model. Results: all glb intervention components were successfully delivered by videoconference with minor adaptations for the different delivery mechanism. Participant retention was 70% and 96% in the in-person and videoconference groups, respectively (p = 0.04). Completing participants in both groups lost a significant percent body weight over the 12 week intervention (p < 0.001) and there was no difference in percent body weight after 12 weeks of intervention (6.2 +/- 3.2% and 5.3 +/- 3.4% for in-person and videoconference at 12 weeks, respectively; p = 0.60). Conclusion: this study describes the first videoconference adaption of the glb program for use in military families. Attrition was lower in the videoconference group, and there were a similar levels of weight loss in both groups regardless of delivery modality. Videoconference weight loss interventions are effective and feasible for scaling to support healthy weight management in military as well as civilian populations.","English",NA,"184",1

The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of telehealth as a tool for the follow-up of children with nondisplaced elbow fractures. We hypothesize that patients treated via telehealth will have comparable clinical outcomes as those treated at our institution, with increased patient satisfaction. We conducted a randomized trial, which included 52 children with type i supracondylar humeral fractures, or occult elbow injuries, divided in two groups, based on the type of care provided during the fourth-week follow-up appointment: cast removal at our institution (group a) or cast removal at home via telehealth appointment (group b). The time duration and professional fees for this week 4 follow-up were calculated. Patients in both groups returned to our institution for a final follow-up in week 8. We measured the amount of fracture displacement, range of motion, pain, and patient satisfaction. There was no statistically significant difference in fracture displacement, range of motion, or pain scores between groups. The mean length of the fourth-week clinical encounter was higher in group a than group b (47.2 vs. 17.6 min, respectively; p < 0.001). Initially, the mean patient satisfaction scores were nearly identical in both groups (97%) until patients in group a were made aware of this difference in time duration, at which their mean satisfaction score decreased to 76.4% (p = 0.05). The use of telehealth as a tool in the treatment of nondisplaced pediatric elbow fractures is appealing. Patients managed via telehealth had higher satisfaction rates and spent only a third of the time for their clinical encounter.","English","cast removal; children; nondisplaced; supracondylar humerus fracture; and telehealth; type I supracondylar humerus fracture","28",1

Methods: we performed a prospective study between november 2016 and september 2017. We leveraged a partnership between mayo clinic and mountain park health clinic, a community clinic that primarily serves un- and underinsured populations. We implemented a mobile phone-based store and forward (saf) teledermatology service, which integrated an external community health clinic to an existing electronic health record (ehr) using standardized data capture forms, real-time support, and simple workflows.

The objective was to estimate the unit cost of art services for pediatric hiv patients and examine the efficiency in the use of resource and treatment compliance resulting from telemedicine initiatives in pediatric hiv compared to usual art services. Methods we selected 6 art centers (3 from linked centers linked to pediatric hiv centre of excellence (pcoe) and 3 from non-linked centers) randomly from three high, middle and low art centers, categorized on the basis of case load in each arm. A bottom up costing methodology was adopted to understand the unit cost of services. Loss to follow up and timeliness of the visits were compared between the two arms and were linked to the cost. Results the average cost per-visit was inr 1803 in the linked centers and that for the non-linked centers was inr 3412. There has been 5 percentage point improvement in lost to follow-up in the linked centers compared to non-linked centers against a back-drop of a reduction in per-pediatric patient cost of inr 557. The linkage has resulted in increase in timeliness of the visits in linked centers compared to non-linked centers. Discussion and conclusion the telemedicine linkage led to an increase in the case load leading to a decrease in cost.

Primary and secondary outcome measures recruitment, retention and data collection rates, clinical outcomes including participant quality of life and anxiety and depression. Results recruitment achieved the target of 40 patients and 37 carers. Participant characteristics reflected those attending the specialist clinic and included those with severe disability and those with limited experience of technology. Retention and data collection was good. Eighty per cent of patients and 82% of carer participants reported outcome measures were completed at 6 months. Using a longitudinal analysis with repeated measures of quality of life (qol), a sample size of 131 per arm is recommended in a definitive trial. The methods and intervention were acceptable to participants who were highly motivated to participate to research. The low burden of participation and accessibility of the intervention meant barriers to participation were minimal. However, the study highlighted difficulties assessing the associated costs of the intervention, the challenge of recruitment in such a rare disease and the difficulties of producing rigorous evidence of impact in such a complex intervention.

Objectives: to quantify the preferences of key stakeholders in israel's primary care-patients, primary care practitioners, and policy makers-regarding vcs compared with traditional in-clinic consultations (icc) in nonurgent conditions. Methods: discrete choice experiment surveys were completed by 508 patients, 311 physicians, and 141 policy makers. These consisted of 12 choice tasks of 2 labeled alternatives (vc or icc), with the 4 attributes most relevant to each stakeholder group. A random effects logit model analysis was used to estimate stakeholders' preferences. Results: all 4 experiments' attributes were significantly important in choosing vc versus icc for the patient group and the physician group. Three out of 4 attributes were significantly important to policy makers. Differences and similarities between stakeholders were identified in attribute rank order, trade-offs, and vc uptake probabilities. Policy makers' vc uptake rate was 86%. Patients' preferences suggested that 68% of iccs could be replaced by vcs. Physicians' vc uptake was 30% in cases in which the consultation purpose was to diagnose and provide treatment and 48% in cases in which the consultation purpose was follow-up. Conclusions: our findings show key stakeholders' preferences about vc integration, to be considered when these systems are introduced into primary care and optimize the implementation process.

Parental misperceptions regarding mental health may interfere with their child's care and negatively influence their child's view of mental health. For some children, their first experience with psychiatry occurs during medical hospitalization when they are seen by the pediatric consultation-liaison (c/l) psychiatry service. Despite this unique role, there is sparse research on how to address mental health stigma with patients and families within the context of pediatric c/l psychiatry. This study explores the use of a brief educational video with messages from the pediatric c/l psychiatry team, families who have accessed mental health consultation in the hospital, and brief video interactions between family and the c/l team, to address mental health stigma. Common misconceptions are addressed during the video with the intent of reducing negative parental perceptions relating to mental health care. Families are given a survey highlighting these concerns, prior to and after watching the video. Pre- and post-intervention responses were compared using paired sample's t-tests. Results indicated that the video did positively change parent's confidence that psychiatry can be helpful, reduced their preconceived stigma regarding confidentiality, while alleviating concerns regarding psychotropic medication use in youth.

Due to growing challenges in ageing societies, for example, patients' immobility and multimorbidity, the transition to specialised care becomes increasingly difficult. Although the co-location of general practitioners and mental health specialists improves the access to psychosocial care, integrated in-person approaches are not practical for rural and single-doctor practices with limited personnel and financial resources. Treating primary care patients via internet-based video consultations by remotely located mental health specialists bears the potential to overcome structural barriers and provide low-threshold care. The aim of this randomised controlled feasibility trial is to investigate the feasibility of implementing of mental health specialist video consultations in primary care practices. Methods and analysis fifty primary care patients with significant depression and/or anxiety symptomatology will be randomised in two groups receiving either the treatment as usual as provided by their general practitioner or up to five video consultations conducted by a mental health specialist. The video consultations focus on (1) systematic diagnosis plus proactive monitoring using validated clinical rating scales, (2) the establishment of an effective working alliance and (3) a stepped-care algorithm within integrated care adjusting treatments based on clinical outcomes. We will investigate the following outcomes: effectiveness of the recruitment strategies, patient acceptance of randomisation, practicability of the technical and logistical processes related to implementing video consultations in the practices' workflows, feasibility of the data collection and clinical parameters.

Several meta-analyses assessing various studies comparing these two methods (cr and tr) have proven that they are at least equally effective, with some of the research showing superiority of tr.

The latter carries a hopeful prognosis for improvement when utilizing a broad-spectrum approach, especially with use of dedicated technological solutions exploiting the fact of a large and yet rapidly increasing penetration of smartphones, mobile pcs and tablets in the population. The above-mentioned findings worked as the basis and rationale for commencing the restore project aimed at developing and delivering state-of-the-art, comprehensive tr for patients after myocardial revascularization and evaluating its molecular aspect in view of how it influences the atherosclerosis progression attenuation. This paper presents the current state and rationale behind the project based on up-to-date tr efficacy data.","English","tele-rehabilitation; myocardial revascularization; optimal cardiac and rehabilitation; reduced rehospitalization rate","26",1

Telemedicine consultation through videoconference is one such modality. Here, we compared patient-reported health outcomes and satisfaction between video-assisted remote and standard face-to-face orthopaedic consultations. Methods this randomised controlled trial included two parallel groups: (1) patients receiving video-assisted remote consultation at a regional medical centre (rmc); and (2) patients receiving standard consultation at the orthopaedic outpatient clinic of the university hospital of north norway (unn). This study included patients referred to or scheduled for a consultation at the orthopaedic outpatient clinic. After each consultation, patient satisfaction was determined using patient-completed questionnaires containing questions on patient-reported health (three-level european quality of life five-dimension index (eq-5d-3l)/european quality of life visual analogue scale (eq-vas)) and questions from a validated outpatient experiences questionnaire (opeq). Results this study included 389 patients, of which 199 received remote consultation and 190 received standard consultation (total of 559 consultations). In all, 99% rmc-randomised patients and 99% unn-randomised patients evaluated the consultation as very satisfactory or satisfactory. Moreover, 86% rmc-randomised patients preferred video-assisted consultation as the next consultation. No difference was observed in patient-reported health after 12 months between the two groups.

Discussion we did not observe any difference in patient-reported satisfaction and health (eq-5d/eq-vas) between video-assisted and standard consultations, suggesting that video-assisted remote consultation can be safely offered to some orthopaedic patients. Moreover, a significantly high proportion of patients selected video-assisted remote consultation as their next consultation, thus strengthening the findings of this study.

In this investigation, we analysed data from a clinical trial focused on innovative delivery of depression treatment to identify which patients are likely to prefer either in-home or in-person treatment based on pre-treatment characteristics. Methods patient satisfaction was assessed in a trial of individuals with depression treated using identical behavioural activation therapy protocols in person or through videoconferencing to the home (n = 87 at post treatment: 42 in-person and 45 in-home participants). The client satisfaction questionnaire was administered at the end of the treatment. A tobit regression model was used to assess moderation using treatment assignment. Regression lines were generated to model treatment satisfaction as a function of treatment assignment and to identify whether and where the groups intersected. We examined the distributions of the contributing moderators to the subsets of participants above and below the intersection point to identify differences. Results while no significant differences in patient satisfaction were observed between the two groups, or between patients receiving treatment by different providers, baseline characteristics of the sample could be used to differentiate those with a preference for traditional, in-office care from those preferring in-home care. Discussion participants who were more likely to prefer in-home care were characterized by larger proportions of veterans and lower-ranked enlisted service members. They also had more severe symptoms at baseline and less formal education.

Video consultations are a promising tool in the provision of home-based palliative care, but an overview of evidence solely on video consultations in palliative care is lacking. Aim: to review and synthesize current evidence regarding the use of video consultations in general and specialized palliative care to various patient groups. Design: a systematic integrative review with a narrative synthesis was undertaken in accordance with prisma (2009) guidelines. Prospero #: crd42018095383 data sources: pubmed, embase, cinahl, and psychinfo were searched for primary research articles published between 2005 and 2018. In addition, reference lists of included articles were hand searched.

Innovative strategies are needed to improve aud treatment access and patient engagement. The ria treatment platform (rtp) is a patient-centered telemedicine aud treatment program accessed through a smartphone application (app) that includes a package of physician visits (with aud prescriptions as appropriate), text- and phone-based support from a recovery coach, video monitoring of medication adherence, and bluetooth-linked breathalyzer tracking of alcohol intake. Objectives: the purpose of the current study is to examine changes in alcohol use among patients utilizing the rtp. Methods: this study examines daily breathalyzer blood alcohol content (bac) readings collected from 77 adult patients (50.7% male) over the first 90?Days in treatment with the rtp. Data were analyzed using dynamic structural equation modeling. Results: the treatment retention rate at 90?Days was 55%. The best fit for the bac data was given by a cubic curve, which showed that among patients who remained engaged for 90?Days average bac levels declined approximately 50% (from .091 to .045) from baseline to day 90. Conclusion: this study provides preliminary evidence of substantial alcohol use reductions among patients utilizing the rtp, an innovative telemedicine program accessed via smartphone. Although other alcohol-reduction apps have shown promise from scientific evaluations, the rtp appears to be the only app that incorporates physician-prescribed medication and a recovery coach.

Objective: this study aimed to determine the degree to which family physicians advocate that mental health specialist video consultations can be integrated into routine primary care, where most patients with mental health conditions receive treatment. Methods: in a cross-sectional qualitative study, we conducted 4 semistructured focus groups and 3 telephonic interviews in a sample of 19 family physicians from urban and rural districts. We conducted a qualitative content analysis applying the tailored implementation in chronic diseases framework in a combined bottom-up (data-driven) and top-down strategy for deriving key domains. Results: family physicians indicated that mental health specialist video consultations are a promising and practical way to address the most pressing challenges in current practice, that is, to increase the accessibility and co-ordination of specialized care. Individual health professional factors were the most frequently discussed topics. Specifically, family physicians valued the anticipated clinical outcomes for patients and the anticipated resources set for the primary care practice as major facilitators (16/19, 84%). However, family physicians raised a concern regarding a lack of facial expressions and physical interaction (19/19, 100%), especially in emergency situations. Therefore, most family physicians considered a viable emergency plan for mental health specialist video consultations that clearly delineates the responsibilities and tasks of both family physicians and mental health specialists to be essential (11/19, 58%). Social, political, and legal factors, as well as guideline factors, were hardly discussed as prerequisites for individual family physicians to integrate mental health specialist video consultations into routine care. To facilitate the implementation of future mental health specialist video consultation models, we compiled a checklist of recommendations that covers (1) buy-in from practices (eg, emphasizing logistical and psychological relief for the practice), (2) the engagement of patients (eg, establishing a trusted patient-provider relationship), (3) the setup and conduct of consultations (eg, reliable emergency plans), and (4) the fostering of collaboration between family physicians and mental health specialists (eg, kick-off meetings to build trust). Conclusions: by leveraging the primary care practice as a familiar environment for patients, mental health specialist video consultations provide timely specialist support and potentially lead to benefits for patients and more efficient processes of care. Integration should account for the determinants of practice as described by the family physicians.","English","video consultations; videoconferencing; integrated behavioral health; and primary care; health services research; mental health","21",1

Despite high hepatitis c virus (hcv) prevalence, opioid use disorder (oud) patients on methadone rarely engage in hcv treatment. We investigated the effectiveness of hcv management via telemedicine in an opioid substitution therapy (ost) program. Methods. Oud patients on methadone underwent biweekly telemedicine sessions between a hepatologist and physician assistant during the entire hcv treatment course. All pretreatment labs (hcv rna, genotype, and noninvasive fibrosis assessments) were obtained onsite and direct-acting antivirals were coadministered with methadone using modified directly observed therapy. We used multiple correspondence analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and logistic regression to identify variables associated with pursuit of hcv care. Results. Sixty-two hcv rna-positive patients (24% human immunodeficiency virus [hiv] infected, 61% male, 61% african american, 25.8% hispanic) were evaluated. All patients were stabilized on methadone and all except 4 were hcv genotype 1 infected. Advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis was present in 34.5% of patients. Of the 45 treated patients, 42 (93.3%) achieved viral eradication. Of 17 evaluated patients who were not treated, 5 were discontinued from the drug treatment program or did not follow up after the evaluation, 2 had hiv adherence issues, and 10 had insurance authorization issues.

In utah, there are three mandatory steps: a state-mandated information visit, a 72-h waiting period, and finally the abortion procedure itself. We explored women's experiences of using telemedicine for the first step: the information visit. Methods: we conducted 20 in-depth interviews with women recruited from planned parenthood association of utah in 2017 and analyzed them using iterative thematic techniques, using a framework based on massey's conceptualization of space as comprising temporal, material and social dimensions. Results: temporal, material and social dimensions of women's access to abortion services intertwined to reduce access and cause discomfort and inconvenience among women in our sample. The 72-h waiting period and travel distance were the key temporal and material barriers, while social dimensions included fear of social judgement, religious influence, and negative stereotyping about people who have abortions. Women described traveling long distances alone and risking excessive pain (e.g. denying pain medication in order to drive immediately after the procedure) to try to overcome these barriers. Conclusion: using telemedicine helped patients reduce burdens created by policies requiring attendance at multiple appointments in a state with limited abortion services. Attending to spatial aspects of abortion provision helps identify how these different dimensions of abortion access interact to reduce access and impose undue burdens. Telemedicine can improve privacy, reduce travel expenses, and reduce other burdens for women seeking abortion care.","English","Abortion; Telemedicine; Information visit; Waiting period; Spatial and theory","16",1

Patients usually need to travel long distances to tertiary care centers for confirmation of a diagnosis. Considering the rapid development of high-speed communication technology, telemedicine will be a significant technology for improving the diagnosis and treatment of patients at secondary care hospitals. Objective: this study aimed to discuss the feasibility and perceived clinical value of a synchronized, real-time, interactive, remote tte consultation system based on cloud computing technology. Methods: by using the cloud computing platform coupled with unique dynamic image coding and decoding and synchronization technology, multidimensional communication information in the form of voice, texts, and pictures was integrated. A remote tte consultation system connecting henan provincial people's hospital and two county-level secondary care hospitals located 300 km away was developed, which was used for consultation with 45 patients. Results: this remote tte consultation system achieved remote consultation for 45 patients. The total time for consultation was 341.31 min, and the mean time for each patient was 7.58 (sd 6.17) min. Among the 45 patients, 3 were diagnosed with congenital heart diseases (7%) and 42 were diagnosed with acquired heart diseases (93%) at the secondary care hospitals. After expert consultation, the final diagnosis was congenital heart diseases in 5 patients (11%), acquired heart disease in 34 patients (76%), and absence of heart abnormalities in 6 patients (13%). Compared with the initial diagnosis at secondary care hospitals, remote consultation using this system revealed new abnormalities in 7 patients (16%), confirmation was obtained in 6 patients (13%), and abnormalities were excluded in 6 patients (13%). The expert opinions agreed with the initial diagnosis in the remaining 26 patients (58%). In addition, several questions about rare illnesses raised by the rural doctors at the secondary care hospitals were answered. Conclusions: the synchronized real-time interactive remote tte consultation system based on cloud computing service and unique dynamic image coding and decoding technology had high feasibility and applicability.","English","three synchronization; double-real-time; interactive; remote and consultation on UCG; dynamic image decoding; synchronization technology","7",1

The aim of this study was (1) to describe pcps', patients', and policy makers' (pms) views of their power and (2) to explore how pcps' views of power are associated with their intention to use vc. Methods: a convergent parallel mixed-methods design was used. Interviews were conducted with five focus groups that comprised 42 patients; five focus groups with 52 pcps; and 24 individual interviews with pms. A total of 508 patients, 311 pcps, and 141 pms completed the questionnaire, assessing intention to use vc and stakeholders' relative power. The qualitative data were analyzed using the thematic method; survey data were analyzed using quantitative methods. Results: all stakeholder groups rated pcps' power as significantly lower, relative to that of patients and managers. Pcps' intention to use telemedicine was found to be significantly related to perceived power gaps between them and patients (r = -0.24, p < 0.001) and between them and managers (r = -0.45, p < 0.001). Themes revealed in the analysis describing how pcps' low power influences their intention to use vc were as follows: pcps' low-impact telemedicine-related decisions, increased work overload, ""big brother"" control, and health maintenance organization demands for telemedicine mandatory usage. Conclusions: to successfully adopt vc, efforts should be made to increase pcps' relative power, by strengthening their involvement in decision-making procedures and by increasing pcps' control over their work environment.","English","PCPs' relative power; telemedicine; primary care stakeholders; intention and to use telemedicine; video-consultations","26",1

The present study aimed to verify if a tetehealth prevention program based on a brief motivational intervention helps to reduce parental risk practices and increase parental protective practices for drug use in comparison with psychoeducation. Methods: a pilot randomized controlled trial was performed at the national service of guidance and information on drug use (ligue 132), from september 2014 to december 2015, with the parents of adolescents (n = 26). The outcome measures were parental style, risk, and protective parental practices. Results: the brief motivational intervention was found to be more effective than psychoeducation in reducing the negligent behavior of parents. Furthermore, when comparing pre- and post-intervention data, the brief motivational intervention helped to change parental style and the large majority of parental practices: increasing positive monitoring, as well as decreasing physical abuse, relaxed discipline, inconsistent punishment, and negative monitoring.

Early identification and treatment are important to improving outcomes. The objective of this study was to identify hospital-specific factors associated with inter-hospital transfer. Design: mixed method study integrating data from a telephone survey and retrospective cohort study of state administrative claims. Setting and subjects: survey of iowa emergency department administrators between may 2017 and june 2017 and cohort of adults seen in iowa emergency departments for severe sepsis and septic shock between january 2005 and december 2013. Interventions: none. Measurements and main results: multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of inter-hospital transfer. We included 114 institutions that provided data (response rate = 99%), and responses were linked to a total of 150,845 visits for severe sepsis/septic shock. In our adjusted model, having the capability to place central venous catheters or having a subscription to a tele-icu service was independently associated with lower odds of inter-hospital transfer (adjusted odds ratio, 0.69; 95% ci, 0.54-0.86 and adjusted odds ratio, 0.69; 95% ci, 0.54-0.88, respectively). A facility's participation in a sepsis-specific quality improvement initiative was associated with 62% higher odds of transfer (adjusted odds ratio, 1.62; 95% ci, 1.10-2.39). Conclusions: the insertion of central venous catheters and access to a critical care physician during sepsis treatment are important capabilities in hospitals that transfer fewer sepsis patients.

This could, for a large part, be attributed to a lack of end-user acceptance. The aim of this article is to look beyond the common theoretical approaches towards end-user acceptance (like the technology acceptance model and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology), and to explore the factors that contribute to or hinder the acceptance of a telemedicine service for rehabilitation care by patients with a chronic disease. Methods: a qualitative, exploratory focus group approach was applied. We involved 188 patients in 22 focus groups. A guide was developed to provoke a discussion among participants of a rehabilitation clinic on the topic of using an online portal with a wide range of telemedicine features (e.g., an exercise module and a teleconference module). Three coders, using thematic analysis, coded the focus group transcripts simultaneously. Results: the focus groups resulted in a wide range of factors that drive or hinder patient acceptance. Facilitators included the possibility to exercise from the comfort of home, the ability to work on one's recovery, irrespective of the time schedule of care professionals, and improved quality of exercise instruction, due to the provision of exercise videos on the portal. Barriers included a lack of intrinsically motivation, experiencing portal-mediated communication with care professionals as 'impersonal', and the lack of physical space and rest to properly exercise at home. Generally speaking, participants were enthusiastic about the idea to provide the telemedicine service as a follow-up treatment as they liked to be in contact with their therapist and to continue training. Conclusion: acceptance of telemedicine services depends on many factors that are not part of well-established theories that explain technology acceptance. These factors are more specific than general determinants, such as ease of use and usefulness, and focus mainly on contextual factors, such as a fit between the service configuration and daily life, personal motivation and the associated psychological burden.","English","Acceptance; Telemedicine services; Online portal; Rehabilitation; and Qualitative research","125",1

As the use of internet videoconferencing is growing, increasing numbers of reviews of literature are published. Methods the authors conducted a review of the existing reviews of literature relating to the use of internet videoconferencing for consultations between healthcare professionals and patients with long-term conditions in their own home. The review was followed with an assessment of united kingdom national institute for health and clinical excellence guidelines for patient care in the context of common long-term illnesses to examine where videoconferencing could be implemented in line with these recommendations. Results the review of reviews found no formal evidence in favour of or against the use of internet videoconferencing. Patients were satisfied with the use of videoconferencing but there was limited evidence that it led to a change in health outcomes. Evidence of healthcare professional satisfaction when using this mode of communication with patients was limited. The review of guidelines suggested a number of opportunities for adoption and expansion of internet videoconferencing. Implementing videoconferencing in line with current evidence for patient care could offer support and provide information on using a communication channel that suits individual patient needs and circumstances. The evidence base for videoconferencing is growing, but there is still a lack of data relating to cost, ethics and safety. Conclusions while the current evidence base for internet videoconferencing is equivocal, it is likely to change as more research is undertaken and evidence published.

Factors that contribute to cardiac patients' lack of participation in rehabilitation programs are patient motivation, logistical difficulties in getting to the rehabilitation facilities, lack of psychosocial elements, and individualization of activities in the rehabilitation programs. Telerehabilitation has been proposed as a new way to address the challenge of engaging and motivating cardiac patients and their partners to participate in rehabilitation. Objective: the aim of this study was to explore the experiences of cardiac patients and their partners of participating in the teledialog telerehabilitation program (ttp). The teledialog program consisted of a digital rehabilitation plan, transmission of health data from patient's home to hospital and health care center, and an interactive web portal with information and training videos. Methods: this case study used a theoretical approach combining the ""community of practice"" approach and self-determination theory. A triangulation of data collection techniques was used, including documents, participant observation (72 hours), and qualitative interviews with cardiac patients and their partners enrolled in the telerehabilitation group. A total of 14 cardiac patients, 12 patient spouses/partners, and 1 son participated in the study. The participants were interviewed at enrollment in the telerehabilitation program and after 12 weeks of participation in the program. Interview data were analyzed using nvivo 11.0. Results: patients and their partners found the web portal activeheart.dk and the electronic rehabilitation (e-rehabilitation) plan to be helpful tools for health education, coordinating rehabilitation goals, creating an overview of the data, and ensuring continuity in the rehabilitation process. The patients felt that the ttp treated them as individuals, gave them a sense of autonomy, and provided enhanced relatedness to health care professionals and partners and a sense of competence as active participants in their own rehabilitation process. Some patients missed being part of a community of practice with other cardiac patients and did not use the web forum. Patients' partners found that the telerehabilitation program gave them a sense of security and helped them balance their involvement as a partner to the patient and not push the patient too hard. Conclusions: cardiac patients and their partners found telerehabilitation technologies a useful digital toolbox in the rehabilitation process. Telerehabilitation motivated the patients to integrate rehabilitation activities into their work schedule and everyday life and made them feel like unique individuals. Participating in the teledialog telerehabilitation program might not be a suitable strategy for all cardiac patients. Being a patient's partner in the telerehabilitation program was associated with a heightened sense of security, navigation between active involvement in the rehabilitation process, being an equal partner, and not pushing the patient too hard.","English","telerehabilitation; heart diseases; social media; qualitative study","21",1

Assessment of usefulness and efficiency of performing teleconsultations to manage stroke from acute care hospital to tertiary care rehabilitation hospital has not been referred by scientific literature. Aim: this article analyzes the process of discharging stroke patients from acute care to intensive rehabilitation, based on the comparison between conventional bedside patient evaluations and teleconsultation patient evaluations, to assess efficiency and efficacy of two different discharging workflows. Design: retrospective study. Setting: consultations were carried out between the acute care stroke unit and the stroke rehabilitation unit of valduce hospital system. Population: the study included 257 stroke patients who underwent physiatric consultation during 2 years considered in this study and 101 patients were considered eligible for intensive rehabilitation treatment after a physiatric consultation. Methods: we compared the efficiency and efficacy of the dismission workflow of bedside medical consultation and teleconsultation over a 12 months period. We considered the following outcome measures: time elapsed between consultation and rehabilitation unit admission, number of re-admissions to acute care hospital, complications occurred during rehabilitation, length of stay in the rehabilitation hospital and clinical outcomes of rehabilitation process. Results: we observed a significant reduction in waiting time from the acute event to the admission in rehabilitation department, an improvement in efficiency of the admission process itself in the rehabilitation unit and a reduction of clinical complications occurred during rehabilitation period, without changes in rehabilitative outcomes. Conclusions: it has been highlighted that the use of telemedicine to perform medical consultation as a tool to evaluate patients eligible for tertiary care rehabilitation hospital admission from stroke care unit is feasible and more efficient when compared with conventional bedside consultations. Clinical rehabilitation impact: this study reveals teleconsultations as a useful tool to improve efficiency of the stroke management workflow.","English","Telemedicine; Remote consultation; Stroke rehabilitation","55",1

Live donor kidney transplantation (ldkt) is underutilized by patients with end-stage kidney disease due to knowledge, communication, and logistical barriers. Material and methods. The talking about live kidney donation social worker intervention (talk-swi) is a previously validated intervention demonstrated to improve patients' access to and pursuit of ldkt through in-person delivery of education and social support. To help overcome logistical barriers to ldkt, we adapted talk-swi into a telehealth intervention employing digital (ie, tablet, smartphone) and telephone technologies. We studied the usability and acceptability of both the mobile device and telephone counseling portions of the intervention among people with kidney disease. For the digital portion, we assessed critical (ie, inability to complete a task) and non-critical (ie, ability to complete a task utilizing an alternative method) errors participants encountered when using the program and their preferences regarding digital materials. Simultaneously, we assessed participants' satisfaction with telephone-adapted counseling compared to the original, in-person counseling. Results. The 15 participants testing the digital technology made 25 critical errors and 29 non-critical errors, while they easily completed 156 tasks (out of 210). A majority of participants (73%) preferred the tablet/smart phone education application over traditional materials, and most (80%) indicated they would be more likely to utilize the mobile platform over traditional materials. Participants testing the telephone-adapted (n = 45) and in-person (n = 125) social worker counseling all reported high satisfaction with the intervention. Conclusion. We successfully adapted a validated educational and behavioral intervention to improve access to ldkt into a usable and acceptable telehealth intervention.","English",NA,"51",1

Cardiac rehabilitation, an evidence-based chd secondary prevention programme, remains underutilized. Telehealth may offer an innovative solution to overcome barriers to cardiac rehabilitation attendance. We aimed to determine whether contemporary telehealth interventions can provide effective secondary prevention as an alternative or adjunct care compared with cardiac rehabilitation and/or usual care for patients with chd. Methods: relevant randomized controlled trials evaluating telehealth interventions in chd patients with at least three months' follow-up compared with cardiac rehabilitation and/or usual care were identified by searching electronic databases. We checked reference lists, relevant conference lists, grey literature and keyword searching of the internet. Main outcomes included all-cause mortality, rehospitalization/cardiac events and modifiable risk factors. (Prospero registration number 77507.) Results: in total, 32 papers reporting 30 unique trials were identified. Telehealth was not significant associated with a lower all-cause mortality than cardiac rehabilitation and/or usual care (risk ratio (rr)=0.60, 95% confidence interval (ci)=0.86 to 1.24, p=0.42). Telehealth was significantly associated with lower rehospitalization or cardiac events (rr=0.56, 95% ci=0.39 to 0.81, p<0.0001) compared with non-intervention groups. There was a significantly lower weighted mean difference (wmd) at medium to long-term follow-up than comparison groups for total cholesterol (wmd= -0.26 mmol/l, 95% ci= -0.4 to -0.11, p <0.001), low-density lipoprotein (wmd= -0.28, 95% ci = -0.50 to -0.05, p=0.02) and smoking status (rr=0.77, 95% ci =0.59 to 0.99, p=0.04].

This gap can be mitigated with high-quality telemedicine (tm). This study aims to explore the effectiveness of synchronous video tm compared to the conventional face-to-face treatment (ftf). Methods: the study was conducted at maccabi healthcare services, a 2.2-million-member sick fund in israel. We reviewed all consecutive visits of leu patients to wound care specialists between jan 2013 and jun 2017. Both tm and ftf modalities were implemented using identical treatment settings with the same nurse at each location. Study endpoint was ulcer healing as assessed by the treating specialist. Results: the study population included 650 leu cases (n(tm) = 277, n(ftf) = 373) and contained 5203 visits. Comparable (p = 0.475) proportions of healed ulcers (52% in tm vs. 55% in ftf) were detected. Survival analyses found a non-significant advantage of tm (0.887; 0.650-1.212) compared to ftf.

Objective: video consultations may be a solution for real-time spc at home. The aim of this study was to explore the use of video consultations, experienced by patients and their relatives, as part of spc at home. Methods: this explorative and qualitative study included palliative care patients in different stages and relatives to use video consultations as a part of their spc between october 2016 and march 2017. Data collection took place in the patients' homes and consisted of participant observations followed by semistructured interviews. Inclusion criteria consisted of patients with the need for spc, aged more than 18 years, who agreed to participate, and relatives wanting to participate in the video consultations. Data were analyzed with giorgi's descriptive phenomenological methodology. Results: a number of patients (n=11) and relatives (n=3) were included and, in total, 86 video consultations were conducted. Patients participating varied in time from 1 month to 6 months, and the number of video consultations per patient varied from 3 to 18. The use of video consultations led to a situation where patients, despite life-threatening illnesses and technical difficulties, took an active role. In addition, relatives were able to join on equal terms, which increased active involvement. The patients had different opinions on when to initiate the use of video consultations in spc; it was experienced as optional at the initiating stage as well as the final stage of illness. If the video consultations included multiple participants from the spc team, the use of video consultations could be difficult to complete without interruptions. Conclusions: video consultations in spc for home-based patients are feasible and facilitate a strengthened involvement and communication between patients, relatives, and spc team members.","English","palliative care; relatives; telemedicine; qualitative research","21",1

We aimed to test the hypothesis that the majority of patients in remote and regional hospitals can be managed using telemedicine and will prevent unnecessary transfers. Methods: a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of patients seen between january 2014 and september 2018 was conducted. Patient demographics, type of teleconsultation modality used, and patient disposition were analyzed. The comparison of continuous data was performed with t-test or mann-whitney test. The categorical data were tested with chi-squared test and analysis of variance. Results: there were 2,842 patients seen in all the clinical disciplines during the study period. We excluded tele-autism and incomplete data. There were 2,724 records eligible for study. The most frequent consulting clinical programs (82.9%) were teleradiology (39.0%), teleneurotrauma (27.2%), and teletestroke (16.7%).

Objective: the aim of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of an orthopedic videoconferencing service between the university hospital of north norway and a regional medical center in a remote community located 148 km away. Methods: an economic evaluation based on a randomized controlled trial of 389 patients (559 consultations) referred to the hospital for an orthopedic outpatient consultation was conducted. The intervention group (199 patients) was randomized to receive video-assisted remote orthopedic consultations (302 consultations), while the control group (190 patients) received standard care in outpatient consultation at the hospital (257 consultations). A societal perspective was adopted for calculating costs. Health outcomes were measured as quality-adjusted life years (qalys) gained. Resource use and health outcomes were collected alongside the trial at baseline and at 12 months follow-up using questionnaires, patient charts, and consultation records. These were valued using externally collected data on unit costs and qaly weights. An extended sensitivity analysis was conducted to address the robustness of the results. Results: this study showed that using videoconferencing for orthopedic consultations in the remote clinic costs less than standard outpatient consultations at the specialist hospital, as long as the total number of patient consultations exceeds 151 per year.

We examined the incremental cost-effectiveness of this intervention vs usual care in canadians with cerebrovascular disease. A markov decision model cost-utility analysis examining community-residing, high-risk patients with a recent nondisabling cerebrovascular event was created. A lifetime time horizon and health care payer perspective were used. Achieved bp, future cardiovascular risks, and attendant consequences on quality-adjusted life years and canadian dollar costs were modeled. Bp telemonitoring was assumed to occur for 3 months, then quarterly. Life tables were used to determine overall mortality, adjusted by cardiovascular disease mortality. Relative efficacies of intervention-associated bp lowering, resource use, and costs were obtained from canadian published literature. Reduction in systolic bp of 9.7 mmhg was used in the base case; subsequently, robust sensitivity analyses were conducted. The results showed that, over the lifetime horizon, telemonitoring with case management led to net health care savings of $1929 canadian and increased per-patient qalys by 0.83. These findings were robust to sensitivity analysis, with the intervention remaining dominant or highly cost-effective. Increasing telemonitoring costs by 50% still resulted in the intervention being dominant; if the costs of telemonitoring plus case management were 2-3 times base case cost, incremental cost-effectiveness was $1200-$4700 per quality-adjusted life year gained.

However, this approach is time-dependent and most centres have yet to achieve the recommended treatment times. We describe a quality improvement initiative aimed at improving the telestroke workflow and treatment times at our centre. Methods a multidisciplinary workgroup comprising clinicians, stroke case managers and radiology staff was formed to oversee the initiative. A phase-by-phase review of the existing workflow was done to identify the reasons for delay. Phase-specific measures were then introduced to address these delays, and a data-monitoring system was established to track the impact of these measures. The initiatives were implemented through four plan-do-study-act cycles. The door-to-needle (dtn) times for thrombolysis and clinical outcomes before and after the interventions were compared. Results a total of 104 patients were evaluated. The median dtn time improved from 96 minutes to 78 minutes post implementation of initiatives (p = 0.003). Fewer patients had symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages (8.5% vs. 24.2%; p = 0.03), and more patients had improvements in their national institutes of health stroke scale score (47.9% vs. 25.0%; p = 0.031) after the initiatives were introduced. Conclusion the quality improvement initiative resulted in a reduction in median din time. Our approach allowed for a systematic method to resolve delays within the telestroke workflow. This initiative is part of an ongoing effort aimed at providing thrombolysis safely to eligible patients in the shortest possible time.","English","door-to-needle time; quality improvement; stroke; telemedicine","60",1

Our study examined how patients responded to tr and whether it provided adequate support for their lifestyle changes and self-care efforts when compared to conventional rehabilitation (cr). Cardiac patients (n = 136) were randomly assigned to a tr or cr group. The tr group was provided with relevant health care technology for a period of three months, and both groups filled in questionnaires on their motivation for lifestyle changes and self-care psychological distress, and quality of life at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients in both groups were found to be equally motivated for lifestyle changes and self-care (p < 0.05) and they experienced similar levels of psychological distress and quality of life. Tr is comparable to conventional rehabilitation in motivating patients, preventing psychological distress and improving quality of life. Although we observed an initial increase in autonomous motivation in the telerehabilitation group, this positive difference in motivation does not last over time. As such, neither rehabilitation format seems able to ensure long-term motivation. Therefore, tr may serve as a viable replacement for conventional rehabilitation when considered relevant.

Furthermore, the use of videoconferencing to deliver evidence-based treatments for ptsd is increasing dramatically. Although videoconferencing has demonstrated non-inferiority to in-person treatment modalities for improving ptsd symptom severity, no studies to date have directly compared qol outcomes of an evidence-based intervention delivered via videoconferencing to one delivered in-person. Methods this study presents a secondary data analysis of two randomized controlled trials comparing cognitive processing therapy (cpt) delivered via videoconferencing or a traditional in-person modality.

Over-occupancy negatively impacts timeliness and potentially, the safety of patient care provided at these two tertiary hospitals. In contrast, underutilization of pediatric beds at regional hospitals poses the risk of losing beds provincially, dilution of regional pediatric expertise and potential erosion of confidence by regional providers. One approach to the current situation in provincial pediatric care capacity is development of telemedicine based innovative models of care that increase the population of patients cared for in regional pediatric beds. A telemedicine rounding and consultation (trac) model involves discussing patient care or aspects of their care using telemedicine by employing visual displays, audio and information sharing between tertiary and regional hospitals. To facilitate implementation of a trac model, it is essential to understand the perceived barriers among its potential users in local context. The current study utilizes qualitative methodologies to assess these perceived clinician barriers to inform a future pilot and evaluation of this innovative virtual pediatric tertiary-regional collaborative care model in alberta.methodswe will use a qualitative descriptive design guided by the theoretical domain framework (tdf) to systematically identify the tertiary and regional clinical stakeholder's perceived barriers and enablers to the implementation of proposed trac model of inpatient pediatric care. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups with pediatricians, nurses and allied health professionals, administrators, and family members will be conducted to identify key barriers and enablers to implementation of the trac model using tdf. Appropriate behaviour change techniques will be identified to develop potential intervention strategies to overcome identified barriers. These intervention strategies will facilitate implementation of the trac model during the pilot phase.discussionthe proposed trac model has the potential to address the imbalance between utilization of regional and tertiary inpatient pediatric facilities in alberta.

Therefore, we have developed a team-based interprofessional and telemedicine-based diabetes management system named tedia (""telemedical diabetology"") and implemented it in an inpatient setting. The aim of the retrospective real-world study was to show the clinical impact of tedia following its implementation. Material and methods: tedia is characterized by an interpersonal and telemedicine-based exchange of hospital routine data between specially trained nurses (""diabetes managers"") and external diabetologists. It was implemented in three acute hospitals of the dusseldorf catholic hospital group in dusseldorf, germany. Clinical awareness of diabetes, diabetesrelated complications and diagnosis-related group (drg)-based revenues were analyzed using icd routine coding. Furthermore, the frequency of hbalc determinations as well as hospitalization days were investigated. Results: before (2010), during (2012) and after the implementation of tedia (2014), the number of patients with icd coding for diabetes, decompensated diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic nephropathy as well as complicated diabetes increased by +18%, +93%, +101%, +113% and +89%, respectively. Using the same drg grouper, revenues increased by +53% (from 27 (2013) to 42 (2014) drg points). Frequency of hbalc determinations rose by +85%, whereas the time for an average length of stay decreased by -12% (-0, 91 days) in comparison to patients without diabetes. Conclusion: tedia improved clinical awareness for diabetes and its complications. This new treatment model increased revenues and reduced hospital days indicating enhanced treatment quality. Our findings emphasize the necessity of novel technologies in inpatient settings for the improvement of efficacy, safety and efficiency of diabetes care.","English","telemedicine; diabetes; inpatient care","12",1

A consistent policy question is whether video consultations (vc) are used as part of rural outreach service provision and the degree to which they partly or wholly substitute outreach visits. This study aimed to explore how commonly specialists providing rural outreach services also use vc to provide clinical service at the outreach site, the aspects of outreach clinical services they consider suitable for vc delivery, whether vc use reduces outreach travel frequency and, if used, has the potential to improve the sustainability of outreach. Methods: the study involved 390 specialists in victoria being invited to participate in an online survey between december 2016 and march 2017. Invited specialists were those travelling to provide rural outreach services in areas of need, already subsidised by the australian government's outreach policy. Analysis included basic frequency counts and proportions and pearson. tests for associations. Qualitative free text responses were analysed and grouped thematically. Results: of 65 respondents, who were travelling to provide rural outreach services on average 11 times per year, 57% (95% confidence interval (ci) 44-69%) used vc to provide aspects of clinical services to the outreach site. They used vc for a median of 12 sessions per year, mainly for one patient per session. Vc was used for non-complicated health care, to support rural gps, undertake clinical reviews or see urgent new patients expediently. Key restrictions were the inability to conduct physical examinations and complex assessments. Vc reduced the frequency of outreach travel for 50% of those using it (95% ci 29-63%) although 43% (95% ci 27-61%) reported that providing outreach clinical services via vc took more time than providing face-to-face consultations. Use was not associated with increased intention to continue rural outreach services for 5 or more years (56% v 62%; p= 0.70) conclusion: more than half of specialist doctors complemented their rural outreach services with vc. However, vc was used infrequently, mainly for one patient per session, for restricted clinical scenarios. Although vc use reduced outreach travel frequency for half of providers, 43% responded that vc takes more time than face-to-face clinical service provision. In conclusion, vc is a potentially useful adjunct to outreach service models, but it is unlikely to replace the utility of face-to-face rural specialist services, particularly for complex care, and may not influence outreach service sustainability in the manner in which it is currently used.","English","Australia; access; health service; medical specialist; sustained and outreach; telehealth; video consultation","19",1

Using claims data for 2010-17 from a large commercial insurer, we identified characteristics of tele-sud users and examined how tele-sud is being used in conjunction with in-person sud care. Despite a rapid increase in tele-sud over the study period, we found low use rates overall, particularly relative to the growth in telemental health. Tele-sud is primarily used to complement in-person care and is disproportionately used by those with relatively severe sud. Given the severity of the opioid epidemic, low rates of tele-sud use represent a missed opportunity. As tele-sud becomes more available, it will be important to monitor closely which tele-sud delivery models are being used and their impact on access and outcomes.","English",NA,"37",1

A 2013 memorandum from the centers for medicare and medicaid services clarified that a telemedicine physician could fulfill the regulatory requirements for physician backup when advanced practice providers were at telemedicine-equipped critical access hospital eds but local physicians were not. In a sample of nineteen hospitals, coverage schedules in 2016 showed that seven had begun the use of tele-ed physician backup for advanced practice providers, decreasing local physician coverage in their eds. These seven hospitals tended to have decreasing ed staffing costs, while the hospitals not applying this policy showed continually increasing staffing costs over time. Telemedicine also provided other benefits, such as improved physician recruitment and retention. In the future, more critical access hospitals will likely use telemedicine to provide physician backup for advanced practice providers staffing the ed.","English",NA,"37",1

Va telederm is a provider-facing, web-based mobile app designed to integrate into the existing teledermatology workflow in the us veterans health administration (vha). In this study, we will conduct a systematic evaluation of va telederm on access outcomes in vha facilities using a pragmatic trial guided by clinical and operational leaders. Methods and analysis the study is a prospective, stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial with cross-sectional exposure and outcome measurement via retrospective database analysis of administrative records. Each cluster is a vha facility deemed eligible for the trial. We assign the intervention using a cluster-level balanced randomisation scheme based on facility size, baseline teledermatology uptake and geographic location. The trial will test whether patients receiving dermatological care at participating facilities will have better access compared with patients receiving care through the current standard process. The primary outcomes proxy for patient-level access to dermatology services, including (1) consult completion time for teledermatology consults; (2) appointment completion time for new dermatology consults; and (3) travel distance for dermatology services. As secondary outcomes, we will assess facility-level adoption outcomes, that is, the number of dermatology encounters and the proportion of teledermatology consults out of all dermatology encounters. To account for secular trends in outcomes and for correlation across individuals within clusters, we will assess the impact of the intervention using generalised linear mixed regression models. Discussion streamlining the current practice for store-and-forward teledermatology in the vha can improve access to expert dermatological care for us veterans. The lessons learnt in this trial could validate the use of mobile technology for consultative store-and-forward dermatology in a large healthcare organisation. The results may also be of interest to other medical specialties assessing the merits of implementing mobile telehealth.","English",NA,"8",1

We then estimate potential ghg reduction if the program was expanded nationwide. Materials and methods: travel distances in miles were calculated for each avoided patient transfer using hospital location data and arcgis tools. Potential ghg reductions from program expansion were calculated based on state and national stroke diagnosis-related groups (drgs). Along with average flight distance from a rural hospital to closest level one trauma center. Results: participation in the access to critical cerebral emergent support services (access) from may 2015 to july 2017 resulted in 2,020 consultations. Of these consultations, there was a 70% (1,414) reduction in patient transfers. Emission reduction totaled 618,772 kg of carbon dioxide equivalents (co(2)e) (618.77 metric tons) or 0.306 metric tons of co(2)e per patient. Expanding the program across new mexico and similar u.s. areas resulted in potential reductions of 4,307 (iqr 3,386-5,274) and 213,279 (iqr 169,320-263,570) metric tons of co(2)e. Conclusion: transport accounts for 26% of global co2 emissions and is one of the few industrial sectors where emissions are still growing. What makes this study more impactful is that aviation's emissions are not part of the kyoto protocol and little is being done in this sector.

Instructions for secondary prevention recommend multifaceted approach in cardiovascular diseases risk management. Center-based physical exercise training is considered as an important integral part of cardiac rehabilitation (cr). Despite all recognized benefits cr brings, active interest of patients remains low in many countries, including the czech republic. That is why there is a need to focus on more effective patients' participation in cr with respect to their preferences and needs. One of possible approaches is using telemonitoring guidance based on obtaining data via technological equipment during home exercise training. The aim of this study is to compare effectiveness of both center-and home-based exercise training with focus on participants' physical fitness and quality of life. Methods/design: this randomized control trial intends to monitor cardiorespiratory health indicators and quality of life of patients diagnosed with a coronary artery disease (cad) at the university hospital brno, czech republic. These patients will be randomly separated into 2 groups-a regular outpatient group (rot) and an intervention training group (itg). Both groups undergo a 12-week rehabilitation training program. The rot group will undergo center-based exercise trainings in the hospital and receive feedback and support directly by their coach. The itg group will be telemonitored during exercise training in their home environment via a wrist sport tester and internet application. All patients will be supposed to exercise at 70% to 80% of their heart rate reserve obtained from cardiopulmonary exercise test (cpx). The primary outcome is to measure and compare physical fitness values assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of training. Physical fitness is expressed as peak oxygen uptake assessed by the cpx test. The secondary outcomes are patients, training adherence, and their quality of life. Discussion: this trial focuses on an up-to-date topic. As there have not been any similar trials in the czech republic yet, we expect it to bring great benefits not only for our hospital in brno. In the long term, this method seems to be low-cost for all participants and brings a lot of benefits for those patients, who are for many reasons unable to participate in center-based cr provided by hospitals and other health care centers. Physical exercise therapy brings good results in reducing cardiovascular risk factors and improves its global impact. Thanks to its simplicity, it is expected to increase patients' training adherence as well.","English","cardiac rehabilitation; cardiovascular disease; Czech Republic; physical and fitness; quality of life; telemedicine","97",1

Results: three critical transition points and system solutions were identified: 1) parents refuse initial referral to the mhc due to stigma regarding mental health services. Solution: during initial referral, parents watch a video introducing them to the mhc. 2) parents don't complete the mhc's screening after referral. Solution: a live videoconference session connecting parents at the fqhc with mhc staff ensures completion of the screening and eligibility process. 3) pcps reject transfer of patients back to primary care for ongoing psycho-tropic medication management. Solution: regularly scheduled live videoconferences connect pcps and mhc providers.

Here we investigated the ""reverse correlation"" from cct imaging to the actual clinical presentation as evaluated by the glasgow coma scale (gcs) and the national institutes of health stroke scale (nihss). Methods: cct images and basic information (age, sex, and time of onset) of 50 patients with hypertensive and lobar ich were presented to 14 experienced neurologists and 15 neurosurgeons. Based on this information, the nihss and gcs scores were estimated for each patient.

Act has been shown to reduce inpatient hospitalization and is increasingly being used as a mainstay of evidence-based psychiatric practice for these clinical populations. The increasing implementation of evidence-based practices has led to the expansion of act in rural areas. Variability in the adaptation of act in rural areas has included accommodation by teams to multiple barriers. One way to increase psychiatric professional efficiency in rural areas is with telepsychiatry and possibly with rural act, but with unknown effects on fidelity and outcomes. Telepsychiatry has been considered a means of expanding the reach of and access to act.

Women with gdm were divided into groups a (n =57) and b (n =50) according to informed consent. According to gdm treatment norms, group b was given routine outpatient treatment and health education guidance. In addition to the interventions in group b, group a was given access to both a smartphone-based telemedicine system and articles providing continuous health education. The pbg level in groups a and b was compared, as were differences in maternal and fetal outcomes. Data were analyzed by t-test, analysis of variance (anova), chi-square test and multiple linear regression, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Resultsfasting blood glucose (fbg) and 2-h postprandial blood glucose (pbg) were significantly lower and premature delivery was significantly less likely in group a than in group b (all p < 0.05). Compared with group b, caesarean section was more likely in group a (p < 0.05). Pregnancy-induced hypertension had a higher incidence in group b than in group c (p < 0.05). Gestational age at delivery was associated with ogtt2h, premature fetal membrane rupture and self-monitoring of blood glucose. Conclusiongdm treatment based on the wechat platform effectively reduces fbg and 2-h pbg and may improve pregnancy outcomes. However, 1-h pbg was not affected by treatment. Obstetricians should consider the ogtt2h value to increase gestational age at delivery.","English","gestational diabetes mellitus; medical nutrition treatment; pregnancy and outcome; WeChat platform","44",1

Design: secondary analysis of a single-blind randomized controlled trial. Setting: community. Participants: adults with ms and chronic fatigue, chronic pain, and/or moderate depressive symptoms (n=163) recruited from across the united states. Interventions: two 8-week, telephone-delivered symptom interventions delivered 1:1: a self-management intervention (n=75) and an ms education intervention (n=88). Main outcome measures: outcome measures were fatigue impact pain interference, and depressive symptom severity assessed at baseline and posttreatment. Potential moderators of treatment effects assessed at baseline were demographics (age, sex, and education), clinical characteristics (disease duration and disability severity), symptoms (perceived cognitive impairment and pain intensity), baseline levels of the treatment outcomes (pain interference, fatigue impact and depressive symptom severity), and cognitive behavioral factors (pain catastrophizing, fatigue catastrophizing, self-efficacy, and patient activation). Results: moderation analyses found significant moderation for fatigue impact but not for pain intensity or depressive symptom severity. Baseline patient activation interacted with treatment group to predict fatigue impact at posttreatment (p=.049). Among participants with high baseline patient activation, the self-management group reported significantly less fatigue at posttreatment than the education group. No other variables moderated the study outcomes. Conclusions: at the group level, participants responded to both interventions, regardless of disease characteristics, demographics, symptom levels, and cognitive behavioral factors. Self-management and education are both potentially beneficial symptom treatments that may be recommended to individuals with ms and chronic pain, fatigue, and/or depressive symptoms.

Aim: the study aimed to explore the views and attitudes of general practitioners (gps) towards video consultation in primary care; specifically, in three broad areas: the benefits of video consultations to patients and healthcare professionals. Potential problems with video consultation and its implementation. The cost-effectiveness of video consultation in this setting. Method: a convenience sample of the views of 12 general practitioners across two primary care centres in north london were identified using topic guide based semi-structured interviews. A thematic framework approach was used to analyse the data collected to isolate main and sub-themes. Findings: three main themes were identified: 1. Technology - gps expressed concerns about the ability of patients to use technology, the availability of technology and the quality of technology available. 2. Utility - encompassing gp's ideas about the usefulness of video consultations to patients, practitioners and the doctor-patient relationship. Gps presented mixed views on the extent to which video consultation would be useful. 3. Practicality - covering the views of gps on implementation and effects on workload. Gps unanimously felt that it was not a practical substitute for face-to-face consultation. There were mixed feelings about it being used as an alternative to telephone consultation. Conclusion: gps did see potential benefits to using video consultations but also expressed concerns that need to be addressed if they are to have full confidence in the system. The views of those who are going to use video consultation as a means of increasing patient access are paramount if such tools are to he a core part of primary care.","English","accessibility; primary healthcare; qualitative; technology; video and consultation","20",1

However, patients exiting a center-based cr program have difficulty retaining its benefits. Objective: we aimed to evaluate the added benefit of a home-based cr program with telemonitoring guidance on physical fitness in patients with coronary artery disease (cad) completing a phase ii ambulatory cr program and to compare the effectiveness of this program in a prolonged center-based cr intervention by means of a randomized controlled trial. Methods: between february 2014 and august 2016, 90 cad patients (unblinded, mean age 61.2 years, sd 7.6; 80/90, 89.0% males; mean height 1.73 m, sd 0.7; mean weight 82.9 kg, sd 13; mean body mass index 27.5 kg/m(2), sd 3.4) who successfully completed a 3-month ambulatory cr program were randomly allocated to one of three groups: home-based (30), center-based (30), or control group (30) on a 1:1:1 basis. Home-based patients received a home-based exercise intervention with telemonitoring guidance consisting of weekly emails or phone calls; center-based patients continued the standard in-hospital cr, and control group patients received the usual care including the advice to remain physically active. All the patients underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing for assessment of their peak oxygen uptake (vo2 p) at baseline and after a 12-week intervention period. Secondary outcomes included physical activity behavior, anthropometric characteristics, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and quality of life. Results: following 12 weeks of intervention, the increase in vo2 p was larger in the center-based (p=.03) and home-based (p=.04) groups than in the control group. In addition, oxygen uptake at the first (p-interaction=.03) and second (p-interaction=.03) ventilatory thresholds increased significantly more in the home-based group than in the center-based group. No significant changes were observed in the secondary outcomes. Conclusions: adding a home-based exercise program with telemonitoring guidance following completion of a phase ii ambulatory cr program results in further improvement of physical fitness and is equally as effective as prolonging a center-based cr in patients with cad.","English","cardiac rehabilitation; telemonitoring; exercise; coronary artery and disease","20",1

However, fewer than 5% of eligible individuals receive pulmonary rehabilitation on an annual basis, largely due to limited availability of services and difficulties associated with travel and transport. The rehabilitation exercise at home (reach) study is an assessor-blinded, multi-centre, randomised controlled equivalence trial designed to compare the efficacy of home-based telerehabilitation and traditional centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation in people with chronic respiratory disease. Methods: participants will undertake an 8-week group-based pulmonary rehabilitation program of twice-weekly supervised exercise training, either in-person at a centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation program or remotely from their home via the internet. Supervised exercise training sessions will include 30 min of aerobic exercise (cycle and/or walking training). Individualised education and self-management training will be delivered. All participants will be prescribed a home exercise program of walking and strengthening activities. Outcomes will be assessed by a blinded assessor at baseline, after completion of the intervention, and 12-months post intervention. The primary outcome is change in dyspnea score as measured by the chronic respiratory questionnaire - dyspnea domain (crq-d). Secondary outcomes will evaluate the efficacy of telerehabilitation on 6-min walk distance, endurance cycle time during a constant work rate test, physical activity and quality of life. Adherence to pulmonary rehabilitation between the two models will be compared. A full economic analysis from a societal perspective will be undertaken to determine the cost-effectiveness of telerehabilitation compared to centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation. Discussion: alternative models of pulmonary rehabilitation are required to improve both equity of access and patient-related outcomes. This trial will establish whether telerehabilitation can achieve equivalent improvement in outcomes compared to traditional centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation. If efficacious and cost-effective, the proposed telerehabilitation model is designed to be rapidly deployed into clinical practice.","English","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Pulmonary rehabilitation; and Telerehabilitation; Telehealth; Exercise; Respiratory disease; and Interstitial lung disease; Bronchiectasis; Asthma","18",1

Randomized controlled trials have shown video consultations to be acceptable, safe, and effective in selected conditions and circumstances. However, this model has rarely been mainstreamed and sustained in real-world settings. Objective: the study sought to (1) define good practice and inform implementation of video outpatient consultations and (2) generate transferable knowledge about challenges to scaling up and routinizing this service model. Methods: a multilevel, mixed-method study of skype video consultations (micro level) was embedded in an organizational case study (meso level), taking account of national context and wider influences (macro level). The study followed the introduction of video outpatient consultations in three clinical services (diabetes, diabetes antenatal, and cancer surgery) in a national health service trust (covering three hospitals) in london, united kingdom. Data sources included 36 national-level stakeholders (exploratory and semistructured interviews), longitudinal organizational ethnography (300 hours of observations; 24 staff interviews), 30 videotaped remote consultations, 17 audiotaped face-to-face consultations, and national and local documents. Qualitative data, analyzed using sociotechnical change theories, addressed staff and patient experience and organizational and system drivers. Quantitative data, analyzed via descriptive statistics, included uptake of video consultations by staff and patients and microcategorization of different kinds of talk (using the roter interaction analysis system). Results: when clinical, technical, and practical preconditions were met, video consultations appeared safe and were popular with some patients and staff. Compared with face-to-face consultations for similar conditions, video consultations were very slightly shorter, patients did slightly more talking, and both parties sometimes needed to make explicit things that typically remained implicit in a traditional encounter. Video consultations appeared to work better when the clinician and patient already knew and trusted each other. Some clinicians used skype adaptively to respond to patient requests for ad hoc encounters in a way that appeared to strengthen supported self-management. The reality of establishing video outpatient services in a busy and financially stretched acute hospital setting proved more complex and time-consuming than originally anticipated. By the end of this study, between 2% and 22% of consultations were being undertaken remotely by participating clinicians. In the remainder, clinicians chose not to participate, or video consultations were considered impractical, technically unachievable, or clinically inadvisable. Technical challenges were typically minor but potentially prohibitive. Conclusions: video outpatient consultations appear safe, effective, and convenient for patients in situations where participating clinicians judge them clinically appropriate, but such situations are a fraction of the overall clinic workload. As with other technological innovations, some clinicians will adopt readily, whereas others will need incentives and support. There are complex challenges to embedding video consultation services within routine practice in organizations that are hesitant to change, especially in times of austerity.","English","remote consultations; diabetes mellitus; ethnography; interviews; and organizational case studies; health systems","20",1

In our research we adopted the human centered approach to design a cognitive rehabilitation platform that is able to provide tools and features tailored to the professional needs and strategies and also able to engage patients in their treatment process. In order to explore the clinicians' point of view on the neuropsychological intervention strategies, we applied two different techniques often used in human factors research: the critical decision method to study professionals' strategies with a descriptive perspective, and the hierarchical task analysis to analyze the processes with a normative view. The results of our research showed that the hybrid approach adopted allowed us to have a better focus on the cognitive rehabilitation process and on the professionals' decision making mechanism. This led to a better understanding of functional requirements for supporting clinician's strategic decision making, in terms of personalization of treatments, cognitive exercises settings and feedback customization. In conclusion, our research highlights the value of the cdm to focus deeply on which ftmcdonalities professionals require from a cognitive telerehabilitation system and allowed us to design more precisely clinician-patients interactions inside the system compared to prescriptive methods currently used. Our study offers contribution to the comprehension of the rehabilitation processes, suggesting the positive impacts of an ""extended"" clinic treatment by adopting a flexible and adaptable tool.","English","Human factors; Critical decision method; Task analysis; Human centered and design; Cognitive telerehabilitation","95",1

However, there is a lack of research on the impact of telehealth (th) use on patient outcomes in post-acute rehabilitation settings. The current study examined the effects of th for post-acute rehabilitation patient outcomes (i.e. discharge setting and change in functional independence) when controlling for other factors (e.g. cognitive functioning). Methods: for this retrospective study, electronic medical records (emrs) of 294 patients who were discharged from a post-acute rehabilitation unit at a skilled nursing facility were reviewed. Only patients with an admitting condition of a circulatory disease based on icd-9 classification were included. Main emr data extracted included use of th, cognitive functioning, admission and discharge functional independence, and discharge setting (returning home vs. returning to acute care/re-hospitalisation). Results: results from a regression analysis showed that although th use was unrelated to post-acute rehabilitation care transition, it was significantly related to change in functional independence. Patients who used th during their stay had significantly more improvement in functional independence from admission to discharge when compared to those who did not use th.

The aim of this study was to examine the validity of clinical decisions made during hand therapy sessions conducted via telehealth compared to a traditional clinical model (tcm) assessment, and explore patient and clinician satisfaction. Methods: eighteen patients referred for hand therapy to a rural/remote hospital-based outpatient service were assessed simultaneously via telehealth and a tcm assessment. An allied health assistant supported data collection at the patient end. Hand function was assessed using a range of objective measures, subjective scales and patient reported information. Minimal level of percent exact agreement (pea) between the telehealth ot (t-ot) and the tcm-ot was set at >= 80%. Results: level of agreement for all objective measures (dynamometer and pinch gauge reading, goniometer flexion and extension, circumference in millimetres) ranged between 82% and 100% pea. High agreement (>80% pea) was also obtained for judgements of scar and general limb function, exercise compliance, pain severity and sensitivity location, activities of daily living and global ratings of change (groc) scores. There was 100% pea for overall recommendations. Minimal technical issues were experienced. Patient and clinician satisfaction was high. Discussion: clinical decisions made via telehealth were comparable to the tcm and consumers were satisfied with telehealth as a service option.

We sought to investigate the feasibility and possible effects of a telemedicine device within the neurological back-up service of an acute care hospital. In a 450 bed academic teaching hospital an experienced neurologist (en) is on call to support the junior doctor at the hospital. Support was possible whether by standard telephone advice (ta) or by audiovisual consultations (avc). In avc the expert used a mobile telemedicine device and so he could establish audiovisual contact from his home to the emergency room and examine newly admitted patients. Technical and patient details including timing and diagnosis were recorded. Video and audio quality as well as impact of avc on diagnosis was rated by the en. Out of about 1200 cases in off peak times, during the study period, 164 avc including remote video examination were done (13.6%). Also 48 cases were documented by pure ta. Video quality was rated to a medium of 1.7, audio quality to 2.1. In 36 cases the audiovisual consultation was influenced by technical issues leading to cessation of avc in 8 cases. Duration of teleconsultation was 17.3 min in avc compared to 8.7 min for ta. The consultation diagnosis in avc was confirmed in 74.4% of all cases compared to 57.7% in ta. Avc was rated as a valuable contribution to the diagnostic workup in 74.3% of all cases seen. In about 40% of all cases avc was not possible due to technical or organizational reasons.

We describe our trial use of telemedicine to treat a patient with primary headache.patient concerns:a 25-year-old woman visited our branch hospital with a chief complaint of recurrent headache. Our branch hospital had no headache specialist, so a headache specialist at our main hospital provided treatment remotely.diagnoses:she was diagnosed with migraine without aura by the headache specialist using telemedicine.interventions:the branch hospital physician and the headache specialist used video conferencing to interview and examine the patient and share cranial magnetic resonance imaging (mri). Audio and camera angle/zoom could be adjusted during interviews, and high-quality video was continuously displayed at both hospitals simultaneously without lag between audio and video. Temporal/spatial resolution was sufficient for proper neurological evaluation. Mri had sufficient image quality and resolution for detailed interpretation. A prescription for medication was issued by the branch hospital physician and confirmed by the headache specialist.outcomes:zolmitriptan was effective in treating her migraine.lessons:telemedicine was useful for treating this primary headache patient and can contribute to regional health care. Future challenges in telemedicine include expanding its use to other areas within the purview of general physicians and headache specialists, covering implementation and maintenance costs, providing adequate explanations to patients and family members, ensuring security of video transmissions, maintaining patient medical records, and supervising treatment.","English","face-to-face examination; face-to-face interview; medical treatment; and primary headache; telemedicine","97",1

The purpose of this clinical demonstration project was to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of a video consultations clinic for veterans with dementia or memory complaints and their caregivers.methods:the dementia clinical video telehealth (cvt) consultation clinic was established to identify, diagnose, and treat dementia in veterans at sites distant from the main medical center. A geriatrician at the main facility provided video consultation to patients and caregivers at seven satellite facilities. Diagnoses made and services provided were recorded after the initial consultation. Patient and caregiver satisfaction with the cvt clinic were assessed.findings:ninety-four patients were evaluated in the cvt dementia clinic (average age=74.7; average mini-mental state exam=24.4). Forty patients had a prior dementia diagnosis, 15 received a new dementia diagnosis, and 20 a new mild cognitive impairment diagnosis. Of the remaining patients evaluated for memory complaints, seven were found to have depression, three had hearing loss, and three had traumatic brain injury. After cvt consultation, common referrals included social work (n=43), neuropsychology (n=36), and brain imaging (n=26). Patients and caregivers expressed high satisfaction with the video consultation and 90% of caregivers indicated they would rather use cvt than travel to see the specialist in person.conclusions:video consultation was well accepted by both dementia patients and caregivers.

Objective: we evaluate the impact of implementing a teledermatology consultation program with dermoscopy on a statewide scale, focusing on access to care and skin cancer screening for medically underserved populations. Methods: descriptive retrospective cohort study of 2385 dermatology referrals from primary care from june 2014 through november 2015. Results: before implementation of electronic consultations (econsults), access to dermatology was limited; only 139 (11%) of 1258 referrals resulted in a confirmed appointment with a median wait time of 77 days. Post implementation, 499 of 1127 consults (44%) were sent electronically, and of those, 16% required a face-to-face visit with a median wait time of 28 days. Ten malignancies were identified via econsults. Overall consult volume remained stable pre- and post-econsult implementation. Limitations: we evaluated econsults in medically underserved populations seeking care at community health centers. Results might not be generalizable to other populations or in other settings. Conclusion: econsults increase access to dermatologic care and reduce wait times for patients receiving medical care at community health centers.

The actual latency (rtt) of geo satellites is about 1700ms to 3000ms, which could lead to capacity utilisation as low as 39% of maximum 464kbps available capacity of our testbed service provider. However, tcp performance could be improved by adopting other transmission protocols which we are currently testing and investigating possible modifications for even more enhance performance over satellite and hybrid (istn) channels network environment.","English","Telemedicine; Satellite; Latency; Healthcare; Telecommunications; and Information Technology; Throughput",NA,1

It has already become an aspect of modern medicine. A number of countries across the world have successfully introduced telemedicine systems, which allows patients access to general healthcare and specialist consultations regardless of the distance separating patients from physicians. We aimed to evaluate the use of a telemedicine system by polish-speaking women for the purpose of gynecological and obstetric consultations. Material and methods: our study used a telemedicine system operated by a healthcare entity offering healthcare services. We prospectively obtained data from polish-speaking patients (residing all over the world) who underwent teleconsultations in gynecology or obstetrics in the period between dec. 1, 2016, and mar. 31, 2018. Results: a total of 244 telemedicine consultations in 185 female patients were evaluated. These consultations were overwhelmingly for gynecological cases (76%). Obstetric consultations, which constituted only 24% of the total number of consultations, involved predominantly pathologies of pregnancy. The mean age of patients who used the telemedicine system was 27 years. Ten percent of the study subjects resided in a country other than poland at the time of their consultation. Only one patient required an urgent referral for an in-person consultation at an emergency department. Conclusions: telemedicine consultations not only offer an easier access to the relatively difficult to obtain consultations with a specialist in the field of gynecology and obstetrics but may also be an alternative to conventional doctors'appointments, chiefly for those women who currently reside abroad or for those who seek an immediate gynecological consultation.","English","telegynecology; healthcare; telemedicine; eHealth","89",1

The provision of healthcare services to inmates in correctional facilities is costly and resource-intensive. This study aimed to estimate the costs of transporting prisoners from 11 queensland correctional facilities to the princess alexandra hospital secure unit (pahsu) in brisbane for non-urgent specialist outpatient consultations and identify the cost consequences that would result from the substitution of face-to-face visits with telehealth consultations. Methods. A 12-month retrospective review of patient activity at the pahsu was conducted to obtain the number of transfers per correctional facility. The total cost of transfers was calculated with estimates for transport vehicle costs and correctional staff escort wages, per diem and accommodation costs. A cost model was developed to estimate the potential cost savings from substituting face-to-face consultations with telehealth consultations. A sensitivity analysis on the cost variables was conducted. Costs are reported from a government funding perspective and presented in 2016 australian dollars (as). Results. There were 3539 inmate appointments from july 2015 to june 2016 at the pahsu, primarily for imaging, general practice, and orthopaedics. Telehealth may result in cost savings from negligible to a$969 731, depending on the proportion, and travel distance, of face-to-face consultations substituted by telehealth. Wages of correctional staff were found to be the most sensitive variable. Conclusions. Under the modelled conditions, telehealth may reduce the cost of providing specialist outpatient consultations to prisoners in queensland correctional facilities. Telehealth may improve the timeliness of services to a traditionally underserved population.","English",NA,"42",1

However, patients struggle to travel to clinic and may experience difficulties between clinic visits that may not be addressed in a timely manner. We wanted to explore how we could improve access to specialist mnd care. Methods: we adopted an iterative, user-centered co-design approach, collaborating with those with experience of providing and receiving mnd care including patients, carers, clinicians, and technology developers. We explored the unmet needs of those living with mnd, how they might be met through service redesign and through the use of digital technologies. We developed a new digital solution and performed initial testing with potential users including clinicians, patients, and carers. Results: we used these findings to develop a telehealth system (tim) using an android app into which patients and carers answer a series of questions about their condition on a weekly basis. The questions aim to capture all the physical, emotional, and social difficulties associated with mnd. This information is immediately uploaded to the internet for review by the mnd team. The data undergoes analysis in order to alert clinicians to any changes in a patient or carer's condition.

Current uptake rates however, remain low. This study assesses the social and economic impact of increasing centre-based cardiac rehabilitation uptake and the additional value of cardiac telerehabilitation using cost-benefit analysis (cba) in belgium. Methods: cost-benefit analysis was conducted to analyse three scenarios: (1) current situation: 20% uptake rate of cardiac rehabilitation; (2) alternative scenario one: 40% uptake rate of cardiac rehabilitation; and (3) alternative scenario two: 20% uptake of cardiac rehabilitation and 20% uptake of both cardiac rehabilitation and telerehabilitation. Impacts considered included cardiac (tele)rehabilitation programme costs, direct inpatient costs, productivity losses and burden of disease. Results: compared to the current situation, there was a net total monetised benefit of 9.18 meuro and 9.10 meuro for scenarios one and two, respectively. Disability adjusted life years were 12,805-12,980 years lower than the current situation. This resulted in a benefit-cost ratio of 1.52 and 1.43 for scenarios one and two, respectively. Conclusions: increased cardiac rehabilitation uptake rates can reduce the burden of disease, and the resulting benefits exceed its costs. This research supports the necessity for greater promotion and routine referral to cardiac rehabilitation to be made standard practice.

Access is a two-way audio-visual program linking remote emergency department physicians and their patients to stroke specialists. Access also has an education component in which hospitals receive training from stroke specialists on the triage and treatment of patients. This study assessed the clinical and economic outcomes of the access program in providing services to rural new mexico from a healthcare payer perspective.methods: a decision tree model was constructed using findings from the access program and existing literature, the likelihood that a patient will receive a tissue plasminogen activator (tpa), cost of care, and resulting quality adjusted life years (qalys). Data from the access program includes emergency room patients in rural new mexico from may 2015 to august 2016. Outcomes and costs have been estimated for patients who were taken to a hospital providing neurological telecare and patients who were not.results: the use of access decreased neuro-emergent stroke patient transfers from rural hospitals to urban settings from 85% to 5% (no tpa) and 90% to 23% (tpa), while stroke specialist reading of patient ct/mri imaging within 3h of onset of stroke symptoms increased from 2% to 22%. Results indicate that use of access has the potential to save $4,241 ($3,952-$4,438) per patient and increase qalys by 0.20 (0.14-0.22). This increase in qalys equates to approximate to 73 more days of life at full health. The cost savings and qalys are expected to increase when moving from a 90-day model to a lifetime model.conclusion: the analysis demonstrates potential savings and improved quality-of-life associated with the use of access for patients presenting to rural hospitals with acute ischemic stroke (ais).","English","Cost effectiveness; stroke; stroke care; telemedicine; patient and transport; tPA; rural healthcare","21",1

The present study investigated participant satisfaction and perception of the quality of service delivery within a clinical trial comparing the delivery of an ebp, prolonged exposure (pe) for ptsd, through home-based telehealth and in-person services. Methods: veterans (n = 67) with ptsd were randomized to receive pe via video telehealth technology (n = 27) or via in-person delivery (n = 40). Participants completed service demographic questions, ptsd symptom assessments, and satisfaction and service delivery perception questionnaires. Results: analyses of covariance were used to investigate the influence of treatment modality on patient satisfaction and perceived quality of service delivery, while controlling for demographics and ptsd symptoms. No differences were observed on the majority of measures, with the exception of participants in the telehealth condition endorsing willingness to drive further for telehealth services as compared with participants in the in-person condition. Discussion: findings illustrate participant satisfaction and acceptance of ebps delivered via telehealth at a level consistent with that of in-person services. Preliminary findings suggest that the experience of receiving telehealth services may be associated with increased willingness to participate in telehealth services again.

Assessment and referrals from rural optometrists are vital to the success of teleophthalmology. While there is good evidence for the efficacy of such services, there is limited evidence for patient satisfaction with video consultation. Methodsto evaluate patient satisfaction with teleophthalmology, the current study recruited patients who underwent a video consultation with lions outback vision, for a follow-up telephone-based questionnaire assessing satisfaction. Regression analysis was performed assessing which demographic features and which features of the video consultation itself were associated with highest overall satisfaction. Resultsone hundred and nine of the 137 eligible patients completed the questionnaire (79.6 per cent; 55 per cent male; mean age 64.61 years). The majority of the participants were either very satisfied' (69.1 per cent) or satisfied' (24.5 per cent) with the service. No one reported being either dissatisfied' or very dissatisfied'. Linear regression did not reveal any demographic or follow-up variables as predictive of greater total satisfaction; however, participants who were older, felt they could easily explain their medical problems to the doctor in the video consultation and believed that telemedicine enabled them to save money and time, and were more likely to report higher overall satisfaction. Conclusionteleophthalmology is a promising new way to overcome barriers to the delivery of eye care services to rural and remote populations.

We explored the feasibility, benefits, preliminary outcomes, and patient satisfaction with a new type of health visit, in which a surgical oncologist used video telecommunication to manage and treat complex cancer diseases, including patients with severe comorbidities. Materials and methods: patients visited local va medical centers throughout florida to engage in video telecommunication visits with a centralized surgical oncologist in miami, who directed their oncology treatment. The average length of stay and rate of unplanned readmission were calculated within each organ. The total mileage saved was calculated by subtracting the distance between the patient's home address and the local va from the distance between the patient's home address and the miami va. Travel costs were determined by the va's reimbursement of $0.415/mile for health-related travel and reimbursement of $150.00 for an overnight hotel stay. A likert scale with both positively and negatively keyed questions was used to assess patient satisfaction. Results: in 24 mo, seven unplanned readmissions occurred among 195 operations. Patients experienced an 80.7% reduction in travel distance and saved a total of 213,007.58 miles by visiting their local va instead of the miami va.

Successful telemedicine networks require specialists adapting clinical practice to provide remote consultations. Variation in experiences of specialists between different countries is unknown. To support future implementation, we compared perceptions of australian and united kingdom specialists providing remote acute stroke consultations. Methods: specialist participants were identified using purposive sampling from two new services: australia's victorian stroke telemedicine program (n = 6; 2010-13) and the united kingdom's cumbria and lancashire telestroke network (n = 5; 2010-2012). Semi-structured interviews were conducted pre- and post-implementation, recorded and transcribed verbatim. Deductive thematic and content analysis (nvivo) was undertaken by two independent coders using normalisation process theory to explore integration of telemedicine into practice. Agreement between coders was m = 91%, sd = 9 and weighted average kappa = 0.70. Results: cross-cultural similarities and differences were found. In both countries, specialists described old and new consulting practices, the purpose and value of telemedicine systems, and concerns regarding confidence in the assessment and diagnostic skills of unknown colleagues requesting telemedicine support. Australian specialists discussed how remote consultations impacted on usual roles and suggested future improvements, while united kingdom specialists discussed system governance, policy and procedures. Conclusion: australian and united kingdom specialists reported telemedicine required changes in work practice and development of new skills. Both groups described potential for improvements in stroke telemedicine systems with australian specialists more focused on role change and the united kingdom on system governance issues.

Stroke survivors and families struggle to navigate the complex healthcare system with little assistance posthospital discharge, often leading to early hospital readmission and worse stroke outcomes. Telemedicine guided education on secondary stroke and fall prevention following inpatient rehabilitation feasibility study examines whether stroke survivors and their caregivers find value in telerehabilitation (tr) home visits that provide individualised care and education by a multidisciplinary team after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Methods and analysis a prospective, single arm, pilot study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of weekly tr home visits initiated postdischarge from inpatient rehabilitation. Newly diagnosed patients with stroke are recruited from a houston-based comprehensive stroke centre inpatient rehabilitation unit, loaned an ipad with data plan and trained to use information technology security-approved videoconferencing application. After hospital discharge, six weekly tr home visits are led by rotating specialists (pharmacist, physical/occupational therapist, speech therapist, rehabilitation physician, social worker, geriatrician specialised in fracture prevention) followed by satisfaction survey on week 7. Specialists visually assess patients in real time, educate them on secondary stroke and fall prevention and suggest ways to improve function including direct medical interventions when indicated. Primary outcomes are proportion of eligible patients consenting to the study, participation rate in all six tr home visits and satisfaction score.

Store-and-forward teledermatology could improve how promptly treatment begins by reducing the delay in obtaining a specialist's opinion. In this study, we compared the delay before care between general practitioners (gps) using a store-and-forward teledermatology intervention and gps addressing their patients with a standard referral letter. Methods: we performed an open-label, pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms. Gp clinics in paris (france) were randomly assigned to use either teledermatology referral (use of electronics to send clinical images taken using a mobile phone) or conventional referral (using standard letters) to care for patients for whom a dermatologist's advice was needed for the diagnosis or treatment of skin lesions. Dermatologists integrated responses to teledermatology requests in their usual schedule. Patients were followed up for three months. Primary outcome was the delay, in days, between the gp's consultation and a reply by the specialist allowing treatment to begin. Analyses were adjusted for clustering of gps and identities of dermatologists. Results: between february and june 2014, 103 patients were included in the study (53 patients of 20 gps in the intervention group). The median delay between the initial gp's consultation and the reply allowing for treatment to begin was four days in the intervention group and 40 days in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio=2.55; p<0.011). Discussion: we showed that a simple store-and-forward teledermatology intervention significantly reduced the delay before beginning care (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct02122432).","English","Teledermatology; teleconsulting","23",1

We review current and innovative ways diabetes specialists consult in the management of inpatient diabetes. Recent findings with electronic medical records (emrs), remote monitoring and intervention may improve the management of inpatient hyperglycemia.

Summary following a 2-year transition of our complex paper-based insulin order sets to be emr based, we leveraged this change by developing new daily glycemic reports and a virtual glucose management service (vgms). Based on a daily report identifying patients with two or more glucoses over 225 mg/dl and/or a glucose < 70 mg/dl in the past 24 h, a vgms note with management recommendations was placed in the chart.

Aim: to explore views of hospice patients, carers and clinical staff about whether videoing patient-doctor consultations is acceptable for research and training purposes. Design: we used semi-structured group and individual interviews to gather hospice patients, carers and clinical staff views. We used braun and clark's thematic analysis. Setting/participants: interviews were conducted at one english hospice to inform the development of a larger video-based study. We invited patients with capacity to consent and whom the care team judged were neither acutely unwell nor severely distressed (11), carers of current or past patients (5), palliative medicine doctors (7), senior nurses (4) and communication skills educators (5). Results: participants viewed video-based research on communication as valuable because of its potential to improve communication, care and staff training. Video-based research raised concerns including its potential to affect the nature and content of the consultation and threats to confidentiality; however, these were not seen as sufficient grounds for rejecting video-based research. Video-based research was seen as acceptable and useful providing that measures are taken to reduce possible risks across the recruitment, recording and dissemination phases of the research process. Conclusion: video-based research is an acceptable and worthwhile way of investigating communication in palliative medicine. Situated judgements should be made about when it is appropriate to involve individual patients and carers in video-based research on the basis of their level of vulnerability and ability to freely consent.","English","Communication; method acceptability; palliative medicine; stakeholder and consultation; video recording","31",1

Rapid administration of lytic therapy increases the likelihood of favorable functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke (ais). At the medical university of south carolina (musc), we implemented a web-based telestroke program that allows patients presenting with ais at a rural hospital to receive expert stroke consultation within minutes. This increases their chances of receiving lytic therapy, and therefore increases the likelihood of good functional outcome. Objectives: our study aims to provide an update on how our telestroke program had developed and the rate and safety of intravenous (iv) alteplase administration through telestroke. Methods: data were collected on all patients evaluated through the musc telestroke program from may 2008 through april 2014. Collected data included national institutes of health stroke scale (nihss) on presentation, number of iv alteplase administrations, number of patients transferred to musc, number of mechanical thrombectomies performed on transferred patients, rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages (sichs), and discharge location. Results: a total of 7,694 consults were performed during the study period. Of them 3,795 (49.2%) patients were diagnosed with ischemic stroke, of those 1,324 (34.8%) received iv alteplase. A total of 1,282 patients were transferred to musc for further care.

Clinical research has found that patient adherence enhances treatment effect; hence, health authorities, clinicians, and researchers strive to explore initiatives contributing to patients receiving treatment. Concurrently, videoconferencing-based treatment is gaining ground within other addiction and psychiatric areas. Objective: the aim of this study was to test whether optional videoconferencing increases adherence to and effectiveness of aud treatment in a randomized controlled trial (rct). We hypothesized that the intervention would decrease premature dropout (the primary outcome), as well as increase successful treatment termination, treatment duration, and treatment outcome (secondary outcomes). Methods: we conducted this study in the public outpatient alcohol clinic in odense, denmark, between september 2012 and april 2013. It was an rct with 2 groups: treatment as usual (tau) and treatment as usual with add-on intervention (tau+i). The tau+i group had the option, from session to session, to choose to receive treatment as usual via videoconferencing. Data consisted of self-reported responses to the european version of the addiction severity index (europasi). We collected data at baseline, at follow-up at 3, 6, and 12 months, and at discharge. Results: among consecutive patients attending the clinic, 128 met the inclusion criteria, and 71 of them were included at baseline. For the primary outcome, after 180 days, 2 of 32 patients (6%) in the tau+i group and 12 of 39 patients (31%) in the tau group had dropped out prematurely. The difference is significant (p=.008). After 365 days, 8 patients (25%) in the tau+i group and 17 patients (44%) in the tau group had dropped out prematurely. The difference is significant (p=.02). For the secondary outcomes, significantly more patients in the tau+i group were still attending treatment after 1 year (p=.03). We found no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to successful treatment termination and treatment outcome. Conclusions: the results indicate that offering patients optional videoconferencing may prevent premature dropouts from treatment and prolong treatment courses. However, the small sample size precludes conclusions regarding the effect of the intervention, which was not detectable in the patients' use of alcohol and severity of problems.","English","treatment of alcohol use disorders; alcoholism; videoconferencing; and effectiveness; adherence; patient compliance; premature dropout; patient and dropouts","4",1

Objective: the aim of this article is to report and analyze our experience with transatlantic consultation via videoconferencing in pediatric cardiology. Methods: in february, 2013, videoconferencing project was launched between a medium-volume pediatric cardiac center in bratislava, slovakia and subspecialty experts from a high-volume pediatric cardiac program at the children's hospital of philadelphia (chop), usa. During 1.5-2 hours videoconferences, 2-3 patients with similar complex clinical scenarios were presented to chop experts. The main goal of the project was consultation on individual patients to validate, alter or radically change clinical management plans. Results: from february, 2013 to january, 2017, 25 videoconferences occurred and 73 cases were discussed. The median patient age was 52 months (range; 1 day-30 years). Forty-six discussed cases were outpatients, 21 patients were in the intensive care unit and 6 patients were discussed post mortem. Thirty-one chop experts from different subspecialties participated actively in patient consultations. The most frequent recommendations were related to single ventricle, pulmonary hypertension or heart failure patients and intervention in complex and/or rare cardiac diseases. Specialists from chop agreed completely with the original care plan in 16% of cases. In 52% cases, adjustments to original plan were suggested. Radical changes were recommended in 30% of cases. Receiving institution adopted recommendations to the patient care fully in 79% and partially in 13% of patients. Conclusions: based on our 4-year experience we consider videoconferencing between medium-size pediatric cardiac center and subspecialty experts from a high-volume pediatric cardiac program a suitable form of medical consultations.

Using geoinformatics, we sought to evaluate the overall impact of telestroke on access to stroke thrombolysis in ontario. Methods: ontario population data (census) were used to overlay polygons created by service area analysis using arcgis 10.1. Service areas were divided into predefined driving times toward the nearest stroke center. Centers were compared after they were categorized as being able to administer stroke thrombolysis either independently or through the telestroke program. Results: of the 12,857,821 people living in ontario in 2011, 99.83% had timely access to stroke thrombolysis, leaving 21,829 people, exclusively within northern ontario, without access. Of the population, 71.86% was within a 30-minute drive of a regional or district stroke center, increasing to 91.28% when the telestroke program was included, for an additional 2,501,121 people. Of the population, 1.85% had access to stroke thrombolysis only through the extended time window (between 3 and 4.5 hours), increasing to 3.86% with telestroke, for an additional 258,618 people. Conclusion: the vast majority of people in ontario have access to stroke thrombolysis. The provincial telestroke program improves timeliness of access for those living in southern ontario, although some remote rural and northern communities remain without access.

Telestroke networks can improve stroke care in rural areas but their role in patients undergoing endovascular treatment is unknown. Aim we compared clinical outcomes of endovascular treatment between anterior circulation stroke patients transferred after teleconsultation and those directly admitted to a tertiary stroke center. Methods data derived from consecutive patients with intracranial large vessel occlusion who underwent endovascular treatment from january 2010 to december 2014 at our tertiary stroke center. We compared baseline characteristics, onset-to-treatment times, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, in-hospital mortality, reperfusion (modified treatment in cerebral infarction 2b/3), and favorable functional outcome (modified rankin scale2) at discharge between patients transferred from spoke hospitals and those directly admitted. Results we studied 151 patients who underwent emergent endovascular treatment for anterior circulation stroke: median age 70 years (interquartile range, 62-75); 55% men; median national institutes of health stroke scale score 15 (12-20). Of these, 48 (31.8%) patients were transferred after teleconsultation and 103 (68.2%) were primarily admitted to our emergency department. Transferred patients were younger (p=0.020), received more frequently intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (p=0.008), had prolonged time from stroke onset to endovascular treatment initiation (p<0.0001) and tended to have lower rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (4.2% vs. 11.7%; p=0.227) and mortality (8.3% vs. 22.6%; p=0.041) than directly admitted patients. Similar rates of reperfusion (56.2% vs. 61.2%; p=0.567) and favorable functional outcome (18.8% vs. 13.7%; p=0.470) were observed in telestroke patients and those who were directly admitted. Conclusions telestroke networks may enable delivery of endovascular treatment to selected ischemic stroke patients transferred from remote hospitals that is equitable to patients admitted directly to tertiary hospitals.","English","Acute stroke therapy; intervention; ischemic stroke; telemedicine","12",1

Clear evidence for the importance of intensity of therapy in optimizing functional outcomes is found in animal models, supported by neuroimaging and behavioral research, and strengthened by recent meta-analyses from multiple clinical trials. However, providing intensive therapy using conventional treatment paradigms is expensive and sometimes not feasible because of social and environmental factors. This article addresses the need for cost-effective increased intensity of practice and suggests potential benefits of telehealth (th) as an innovative model of care in physical therapy. Summary of key points: we provide an overview of th and present evidence that a web-supported program, used in conjunction with constraint-induced therapy (cit), can increase intensity and adherence to a rehabilitation regimen. The design and feasibility testing of this web-based program, ""lifecit,"" is presented. We describe how wearable sensors can monitor activity and provide feedback to patients and therapists. The methodology for the development of a wearable device with embedded inertial and mechanomyographic sensors, algorithms to classify functional movement, and a graphical user interface to present meaningful data to patients to support a home exercise program is explained. Recommendations for clinical practice: we propose that wearable sensor technologies and th programs have the potential to provide most-effective, intensive, home-based stroke rehabilitation.","English","internet; stroke; telehealth; upper limb; wearable sensors","41",1

Design: randomized controlled trial. Methods: 165 patients with t2d were randomized 1: 1 to telemedicine intervention as add-on to clinic-based care or control (clinic-based care). The intervention consisted of monthly video conferences with a nurse via a tablet computer and lasted for 32 weeks. Regularly self-monitored measurements of blood sugar, blood pressure and weight were uploaded and visible to patient and nurse. Both groups were followed up six months after the end of the intervention period. Primary endpoint: hba1c after eight months. Results: video conferences preceded by uploads of measurements as add-on to clinic-based care led to a significant reduction of hba1c compared to that in standard care (0.69% vs 0.18%, p = 0.022). However, at six-month follow-up, the inter-group difference in hba1c-reduction was no longer significant. Non-completers had higher hba1c levels at baseline and a lower degree of education. Conclusion: video consultations preceded by uploading relevant measurements can lead to clinically and statistically significant improvements in glycemic control among patients who have not responded to standard regimens. However, continuing effort and attention are essential as the effect does not persist when intervention ends. Furthermore, future studies should focus on differentiation as the most vulnerable patients are at greater risk of non-adherence.","English",NA,"176",1

The interpregnancy time window offers a unique opportunity to intervene in order to acquire a healthy lifestyle before the start of a new pregnancy. Methods: inter-act is an e health driven multicentre randomised controlled intervention trial targeting women at high risk of pregnancy- and birth related complications. Eligible women are recruited for the study at day 2 or 3 postpartum. At week 6 postpartum, participants are randomised into the intervention or control arm of the study. The intervention focuses on weight, diet, physical activity and mental well-being, and comprises face-to-face coaching, in which behavioural change techniques are central, and use of a mobile application, which is bluetooth-connected to a weighing scale and activity tracker. The intervention is rolled out postpartum (4 coaching sessions between week 6 and month 6) and in a new pregnancy (3 coaching sessions, one in each trimester of pregnancy); the mobile app is used throughout the two intervention phases. Data collection includes data from the medical record of the participants (pregnancy outcomes and medical history), anthropometric data (height, weight, waist- and hip circumferences, skinfold thickness and body composition by bio-electrical impedance analysis), data from the mobile app (physical activity and weight; intervention group only) and questionnaires (socio-demographics, breastfeeding, food intake, physical activity, lifestyle, psychosocial factors and process evaluation). Medical record data are collected at inclusion and at delivery of the subsequent pregnancy. All other data are collected at week 6 and month 6 postpartum and every subsequent 6 months until a new pregnancy, and in every trimester in the new pregnancy. Primary outcome is the composite endpoint score of pregnancy- induced hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, caesarean section, and large-for-gestational-age infant in the subsequent pregnancy.

Although antiviral regimens are becoming simpler, hepatitis c antivirals are not typically prescribed by primary care providers. The veterans affairs extension for community health outcomes (va-echo) program was launched to promote primary care-based hepatitis c treatment using videoconferencing-based specialist support. We aimed to assess whether primary care provider participation in va-echo was associated with hepatitis c treatment and sustained virologic response. Methods: we identified 4173 primary care providers (n = 152 sites) responsible for 38,753 patients with chronic hepatitis c infection. A total of 6431 patients had a primary care provider participating in va-echo; 32,322 patients had an unexposed primary care provider. Exposure was modeled as a patient-level time-varying covariate. Patients became exposed after primary care provider participation in >= 1 va-echo session. Multivariable cox proportional hazards frailty modeling assessed the association between va-echo exposure and hepatitis c treatment. Among treated patients, modified poisson regression assessed the relationship between exposure and sustained virologic response. Results: after adjustment, exposed patients received significantly higher rates of antiviral treatment compared with unexposed patients (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.32; p <. 01). The rate of primary care provider-initiated antiviral medication was 21.4% among treated patients reviewed on va-echo teleconferences compared with 2.5% among unexposed patients (p <. 01). No difference in adjusted rates of sustained virologic response was observed for patients with exposed primary care providers (p = .32), with similar crude rates for primary care providers versus specialists.

The aim of this study is to compare the effects of early inhomecare (prehomecare) including video consultations and mobile applications with those of inhospital consultations regarding breast feeding, parental confidence and parent-infant interactions. Methods and analysis: a randomised controlled intervention study will be conducted in four neonatal departments offering prehomecare (ie, premature infant inhomecare) in denmark. Parents of hospitalised premature infants who fulfil the inclusion criteria for prehomecare will be randomised during hospitalisation to either the intervention (n=80) or control group (n=80) using 1:1 block randomisation. During prehomecare, the intervention group will receive a smartphone application with a video system and an infant scale, and the control group will receive usual care (ie, hospital consultations). Additionally, both groups will have planned nurse consultations two to three times a week: the intervention group through video consultations and the control group through inhospital consultations. Data collection will occur at inclusion/baseline, at the end of prehomecare and 1 month after discharge using questionnaires and hospital records. The primary outcome is the proportion of exclusively breastfed infants 1 month after discharge/end of prehomecare, the secondary outcomes are parent-infant interactions measured by the mother and baby interaction scale and family confidence in caring for infants measured by the karitane parenting confidence scale. The process evaluation will consist of two qualitative studies: a field study and an interview study. Data collection will initially involve field observations of three scheduled video consultations with six families from the intervention group.

Data suggest that as many as 25% of veterans do not have a comprehensive traumatic brain injury evaluation to determine a diagnosis and develop a plan to treat symptoms. Technologies like clinical video telehealth offer a potential means to overcome travel distance and other barriers that can impact veteran receipt of a comprehensive traumatic brain injury evaluation after a positive screening; however, little is known about implementing clinical video telehealth in this context. Objective: to examine the perspectives of veterans health administration health care providers on implementing clinical video telehealth technology for the assessment and treatment of mild traumatic brain injury among veterans of operation enduring freedom, operation iraqi freedom, and operation new dawn. Design: qualitative; semistructured interviews. Setting: veterans health administration polytrauma system of care. Participants: twenty-six providers who participated in a veterans health administration rehabilitation and prosthetic services teleconsultation pilot project for administering comprehensive traumatic brain injury evaluations over clinical video telehealth. Methods: semistructured interviews that used content-analytic techniques to assess provider experiences implementing clinical video telehealth for veterans with traumatic brain injury, including inhibiting factors and best practices to administer comprehensive traumatic brain injury evaluations. Results: the most commonly reported inhibiting factors to implementing clinical video telehealth for traumatic brain injury evaluation and treatment included scheduling, setting up the clinic, and conducting physical examinations over a virtual modality. To enhance clinical video telehealth implementation, participants described best practices including establishing solid communication and relationships with staff, building rapport with patients, and recognizing the unique needs of patients with traumatic brain injury. Conclusions: implementing clinical video telehealth programs involves coordinating multiple steps with providers at different sites, highlighting the need for effective communication. Provider-patient communication also emerged as vital to successful clinical video telehealth implementation. These findings suggest that providers would benefit from efforts to build communication competencies.","English",NA,"9",1

Materials and methods: we used the central data store, including all cctg records collected in campania region (italy) during 17 years of activity. The operations center acquires the traces recorded in the remote units and simultaneously performs a complex fetal heart rate analysis. An internet or phone conference calling is available to discuss the information transmitted. Finally, the report is send back to the remote units. Results: the number of cctg traces performed was constantly increasing, despite the progressive reduction in the number of peripheral units involved. Pregnant women in remote unit group were younger and overweight and showed a higher incidence of diabetes and fetal defects than operations center ones. Moreover, a high rate of african migrant women and low socioeconomic and cultural standards were found in remote unit group. The cost analysis showed an economic advantage both in the reduction of inappropriate admissions and in the improvement of admission indicators (hospital stay days) for pregnant women. Discussion: the global economic recession has had a significant impact on the italian regional healthcare system and socioeconomic deprivation. Conclusions: telemedicine could avoid unnecessary referral to level iii centers (hospital) in campania region, where the average population density is very high, allowing equal access to ultra-specialist assessment irrespective of the geographical location of the pregnant woman with medium to high risk, as well as rationalizing the costs for maternal and fetal care.","English","e-health; medical records; telemedicine; distance","23",1

Introduction: we assessed the hypothesis that increased utilization reflected improved access among impoverished inner-city children to a level experienced by more affluent suburban children. This observational study compared utilization among children without and with telemedicine access, beginning in 1993, ending in 2007, and based on 84,287 child-months of billing claims-based observation. Materials and methods: health-e-access telemedicine was initiated in stepwise manner over 187 study-months among 74 access sites (childcare, schools, community centers), beginning in month 105. Children dwelled in inner city, rest-of-city rochester, ny, or in surrounding suburbs. Rate of total acute care visits (office, ed, telemedicine) was measured as visits per 100 child-years. Observed utilization rates were adjusted in multivariate analysis for age, sex, insurance type, and season of year. Results: when both suburban and inner-city children lacked telemedicine access, overall acute illness visits were 75% greater among suburban than inner-city children (suburban: inner-city rate ratio 1.75, p < 0.0001). After telemedicine became available to innercity children, their overall acute visits approximated those of suburban children (suburban: inner-city rate ratio 0.80, p = 0.07), whereas acute visits among suburban children remained at least (worst-case comparison) 56% greater than inner-city children without telemedicine (rate ratio 1.56, p < 0.0001). Discussion: at baseline, overall acute illness utilization of suburban children exceeded that of inner-city children. Overall utilization for inner-city children increased with telemedicine to that of suburban children at baseline. Without telemedicine, however, inner-city use remained substantially less than for suburban counterparts. Conclusions: health-e-access telemedicine redressed socioeconomic disparities in acute care access in the rochester area, thus contributing to a more equitable community.","English","pediatrics; telemedicine; telehealth; information management; healthcare and access; equity","23",1

Key users include older people living with disabilities who are frequent users of hospital rehabilitation services but whose voices are rarely heard. It is unclear whether the use of technologies and reduced face-to-face contact is acceptable to these people. We report on a qualitative study of community dwelling participants who had received a home telerehabilitation programme as an alternative to conventional rehabilitation. Design thirteen older participants, three spouses and one carer were interviewed. All had participated in an individualized therapy programme, using a combination of face-to-face and video consults with therapists. The programme used 'off-the-shelf' technologies including ipads for videoconferencing and electronic fitbit(r) devices. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using nvivo software. Results thematic analysis resulted in five emergent themes: (i) telerehabilitation is convenient; (ii) telerehabilitation promotes motivation and self-awareness; (iii) telerehabilitation fosters positive therapeutic relationships; (iv) mastering technologies used by younger relatives is a valued aspect of telerehabilitation; and (v) telerehabilitation does not replace traditional face-to-face rehabilitation therapies. Conclusions participants found telerehabilitation convenient and motivating, coped well with the technology and developed positive therapeutic relationships. The learning and practice aspects sat well in the context of a rehabilitation programme. The use of commercially available technologies may have contributed to respondents' high levels of acceptability. The perception of telerehabilitation as complementary to in-person care and the expectation of technological support have implications for the implementation and delivery of telerehabilitation services to older people.","English","home rehabilitation; older people; Telehealth; telerehabilitation","20",1

A quality assurance/quality improvement (qa/qi) study was conducted over a 1-month period during which patients with hand injuries, facial injuries, or acute wounds presenting to the emergency department (ed) of a level-one trauma centre and university hospital were monitored. The study utilized a commercial ipad application through which up to four images and a brief history could be sent to a remote plastic surgery educator (pse) for evaluation. The pse would respond with best practice information, references and videos to assist ed point-of-care providers. During the 1-month period of this study, there were 42 ed consultations for plastic surgical conditions. There was a highly significant difference in overall mean response time between consultants and pses (48.3 minutes vs. 8.9 minutes respectively, p < 0.001).

A trained study coordinator took anterior segment photographs (as) and posterior segment photographs (ps) with a portable camera (pictorplus, volk optical, cleveland, oh). Ophthalmologists (graders) determined photograph quality, presence of pathology, and their confidence in disease detection. At a separate session, graders reassessed photographs accompanied by a one-sentence summary of demographics and chief complaint (chx). We computed accuracy and reliability statistics. Results: we took as photographs of 24 eyes of 15 patients and ps photographs of 39 eyes of 20 patients. The majority of images were rated as acceptable or excellent in quality (as: 89-96%; ps: 70-75%).

To increase access to specialist care, video consultation between patients in primary healthcare and specialist care has been used. In order for this new method to be developed and used to the fullest, it is important to understand healthcare personnel's experiences with this intervention. Objective: the aim of this study was to describe healthcare personnel's experiences using video consultation in their work in primary healthcare. Method: a mixed methods design was used, and the data were analysed using qualitative and quantitative analysis methods. Interviews were conducted with eight general practitioners and one district nurse, all of whom had conducted a video consultation with a patient and a specialist physician or a cardiac specialist nurse. After each video consultation, the participants completed a consultation report/questionnaire. Results: healthcare personnel considered video consultation to provide quicker access to specialist care for the patient, and greater security when the video consultation encounter was conducted at their own primary healthcare centre. They considered video consultation an opportunity to provide education and for the patients to ask questions. Conclusion: video consultation is a satisfactory tool for healthcare personnel, and the technology is a new, useful method, especially for the district nurses. Further, video consultation is an opportunity for healthcare personnel to learn. However, for it to work as an accepted method, the technology must function well and be user friendly. It must also be clear that it is beneficial for the patients and the healthcare personnel.","English","healthcare personnel; mixed methods; rural area; specialist care; video and consultation","18",1

It is a large geographic area (385,000 km(2)) and is home to 32 remote first nations communities, most without road access. These communities suffer a heavy burden of infectious disease and specialist consultations are difficult to obtain. The division of infectious diseases at the ottawa hospital and the sioux lookout meno ya win health centre established a telemedicine-based infectious disease consultation service in july 2014. We describe the implementation of this service, types of cases seen and patient satisfaction, as well as some of the challenges encountered. Information on visits was prospectively collected through an administrative database, and patient satisfaction surveys were administered after each initial consultation. During our first year of operation, 191 teleconsultations occurred: 76 initial consultations, 82 follow-up appointments and 33 case conferences. The scope of cases has been broad, mostly involving musculoskeletal infections (26%), followed by skin and soft tissue infections (23%). Hcv, acute rheumatic fever, and respiratory infections (including pulmonary tuberculosis) were other diagnoses. Patient satisfaction has been very high and 28 telemedicine patient visits have occurred in their remote home communities, minimizing travel. The infectious disease consulting service and local clinicians have succeeded in addressing needs for care in infectious diseases in northwestern ontario, where important gaps in service to first nations' communities continue to exist. Regular scheduled available access to an infectious disease specialist is a well-received advancement of care in this remote region of canada.","English","Telemedicine; infectious diseases; remote; indigenous","23",1

However, implementation of telemedicine may be challenging. To illustrate this fact, we report a study showing that telemedicine failed to improve clinical outcome and analyze the reasons for this shortcoming. Methods: we established a tele-stroke network of 10 emergency rooms (ers) of community hospitals connected to a stroke center to perform a randomized, open-label clinical trial with blinded outcome evaluation. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to either a usual care arm (i.e. immediate transfer to the stroke center and administration of iv rt-pa if indication was confirmed upon stroke arrival) or tele-thrombolysis arm (i.e. immediate administration of iv rt-pa in er and transfer to the stroke center). The primary efficacy outcome was an excellent outcome (modified rankin scale (mrs) 0-1 at 90 days). Secondary endpoints included favorable outcome (90-day mrs 0-2) and early neurological improvement (nihss score 0-1 at 24 hours or a decrease of >= 4 points within 24 hours). Safety outcomes included symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ich) per ecass ii definition, any ich and all-cause mortality. Results: during an accrual time of 48 months, because of a slow enrollment rate, only 49 of 270 patients initially planned for inclusion were randomized into usual care (n = 23) and tele-thrombolysis (n = 26). Despite random assignment, patients allocated to tele-thrombolysis were older and had more severe stroke than patients allocated to usual care. The median duration of video-conference was 23 minutes in the usual care arm and 73 minutes in the tele-thrombolysis arm. Eightyfour percent of patients in the tele-thrombolysis arm were treated by iv rt-pa in comparison to 18% in the usual care arm. In univariate analysis but not after adjustment for age and baseline nihss, patients allocated in the usual care arm had a higher rate of excellent or favorable outcome. There were no differences in safety outcomes, with only one symptomatic ich occurring in the tele-thrombolysis arm. Conclusions: stroke patients included in the telemedicine arm of the trust-tpa trial increased their rt-pa eligibility five-fold. However, the efficacy and safety remains to be determined.","English","Telemedicine; teleneurology","23",1

In this work, we shed light on users' acceptance of mhealth with the example of mobile video consultation with a doctor. Our quantitative study is based on a survey of 210 respondents. We draw on technology acceptance model, one of the most-used and often-cited concepts for explaining adoption behavior for newly introduced technologies and technical services. The results reveal that an interaction between personal innovativeness and perceived privacy risk has an effect on user's perceived ease of use. The findings contribute to research by enhancing our understanding of mhealth adoption from a user's acceptance perspective.","English","mHealth; video consultation; technology acceptance; mobile service",NA,1
