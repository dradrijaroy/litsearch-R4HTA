Few studies have assessed the economic benefits of telemedicine, which may contribute to underfunding in potentially important programs. We aim to systematically review the literature on economic evaluations of telemedicine in diabetes care, assess the quality, and summarize the evidence on driver of cost-effectiveness. Materials and methods: a literature search was performed in 10 databases from inception until february 2018. All economic evaluations assessing the economic evaluation of telemedicine in diabetes were eligible for inclusion. We subsequently evaluated the study quality in terms of effectiveness measures, cost measure, economic model, as well as time horizon. Results: of the 1877 studies identified, 14 articles were included in our final review. The healthcare providers' fees are a major predictor for total cost. In particular, the use of telemedicine for retinal screening was beneficial and cost-effective for diabetes management, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between $113.48/quality-adjusted life year (qaly) and $3,328.46/qaly (adjusted to 2017 inflation rate). Similarly, the use of telemonitoring and telephone reminders was cost-effective in diabetes management. Conclusions: among all telemedicine strategies examined, teleophthalmology was the most cost-effective intervention. Future research is needed to provide evidence on the long-term experience of telemedicine and facilitate resource allocation.","English","Costâ€“effectiveness analysis and Diabetes management and Systematic review. and Telemedicine","20",2

A systematic review of economic evaluations of mhealth solutions.","Plos one","2017","10.1371/journal.pone.0170581 ","Background: mobile health (mhealth) is often reputed to be cost-effective or cost-saving. Despite optimism, the strength of the evidence supporting this assertion has been limited. In this systematic review the body of evidence related to economic evaluations of mhealth interventions is assessed and summarized. Methods: seven electronic bibliographic databases, grey literature, and relevant references were searched. Eligibility criteria included original articles, comparison of costs and consequences of interventions (one categorized as a primary mhealth intervention or mhealth intervention as a component of other interventions), health and economic outcomes and published in english. Full economic evaluations were appraised using the consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards (cheers) checklist and the prisma guidelines were followed. Results: searches identified 5902 results, of which 318 were examined at full text, and 39 were included in this review. The 39 studies spanned 19 countries, most of which were conducted in upper and upper-middle income countries (34, 87.2%). Primary mhealth interventions (35, 89.7%), behavior change communication type interventions (e.g., improve attendance rates, medication adherence) (27, 69.2%), and short messaging system (sms) as the mhealth function (e.g., used to send reminders, information, provide support, conduct surveys or collect data) (22, 56.4%) were most frequent; the most frequent disease or condition focuses were outpatient clinic attendance, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. The average percent of cheers checklist items reported was 79.6% (range 47.62-100, std 14.18) and the top quartile reported 91.3-100%. In 29 studies (74.3%), researchers reported that the mhealth intervention was cost-effective, economically beneficial, or cost saving at base case. Conclusions: findings highlight a growing body of economic evidence for mhealth interventions. Although all studies included a comparison of intervention effectiveness of a health-related outcome and reported economic data, many did not report all recommended economic outcome items and were lacking in comprehensive analysis. The identified economic evaluations varied by disease or condition focus, economic outcome measurements, perspectives, and were distributed unevenly geographically, limiting formal meta-analysis. Further research is needed in low and low-middle income countries and to understand the impact of different mhealth types. Following established economic reporting guidelines will improve this body of research.","English",NA,"12",2

The last 2 years have seen important additions to our understanding of when, where, and how telemedicine in the icu adds value. Recent findings: recent publications and a recent meta-analysis confirm that tele-icu improves core clinical outcomes for icu patients. Recent evidence further demonstrates that comprehensive tele-icu programs have the potential to quickly recuperate their implementation and operational costs and significantly increase case volumes and direct contribution margins particularly if additional logistics and care standardization functions are embedded to optimize icu bed utilization and reduce complications. Even though the adoption of tele-icu is increasing and the vast majority of today's medical graduates will regularly use some form of telemedicine and/or tele-icu, telemedicine modules have not consistently found their way into educational curricula yet. Tele-icu can be used very effectively to standardize supervision of medical trainees in bedside procedures or point-of-care ultrasound exams, especially during off-hours. Lastly, tele-icus routinely generate rich operational data, as well as risk-adjusted acuity and outcome data across the spectrum of critically ill patients, which can be utilized to support important clinical research and quality improvement projects. Summary: the value of tele-icu to improve patient outcomes, optimize icu bed utilization, increase financial performance and enhance educational opportunities for the next generation of providers has become more evident and differentiated in the last 2 years.","English","electronic ICU; tele-ICU; telemedicine","32",2

S.","The cost-effectiveness of digital health interventions on the management of cardiovascular diseases: systematic review.","Journal of medical internet research","2019","10.2196/13166 ","Background: with the advancement in information technology and mobile internet, digital health interventions (dhis) are improving the care of cardiovascular diseases (cvds). The impact of dhis on cost-effective management of cvds has been examined using the decision analytic model-based health technology assessment approach. Objective: the aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of the decision analytic model-based studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of dhis on the management of cvds. Methods: a literature review was conducted in medline, embase, cumulative index to nursing and allied health literature complete, psycinfo, scopus, web of science, center for review and dissemination, and institute for ieee xplore between 2001 and 2018. Studies were included if the following criteria were met: (1) english articles, (2) dhis that promoted or delivered clinical interventions and had an impact on patients' cardiovascular conditions, (3) studies that were modeling works with health economic outcomes of dhis for cvds, (4) studies that had a comparative group for assessment, and (5) full economic evaluations including a cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-utility analysis, cost-benefit analysis, and cost-consequence analysis. The primary outcome collected was the cost-effectiveness of the dhis, presented by incremental cost per additional quality-adjusted life year (qaly). The quality of each included study was evaluated using the consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards. Results: a total of 14 studies met the defined criteria and were included in the review. Among the included studies, heart failure (7/14, 50%) and stroke (4/14, 29%) were two of the most frequent cvds that were managed by dhis. A total of 9 (64%) studies were published between 2015 and 2018 and 5 (36%) published between 2011 and 2014. The time horizon was <= 1 year in 3 studies (21%), > 1 year in 10 studies (71%), and 1 study (7%) did not declare the time frame. The types of devices or technologies used to deliver the health interventions were short message service (1/14, 7%), telephone support (1/14, 7%), mobile app (1/14, 7%), video conferencing system (5/14, 36%), digital transmission of physiologic data (telemonitoring; 5/14, 36%), and wearable medical device (1/14, 7%). The dhis gained higher qalys with cost saving in 43% (6/14) of studies and gained qalys at a higher cost at acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (icer) in 57% (8/14) of studies. The studies were classified as excellent (0/14, 0%), good (9/14, 64%), moderate (4/14, 29%), and low (1/14, 7%) quality. Conclusions: this study is the first systematic review of decision analytic model-based cost-effectiveness analyses of dhis in the management of cvds. Most of the identified studies were published recently, and the majority of the studies were good quality cost-effectiveness analyses with an adequate duration of time frame. All the included studies found the dhis to be cost-effective.","English","*cardiovascular diseases and *cost-effectiveness and *decision modeling and *heart attack and *heart failure and *medical economics and *myocardial infarction and *stroke and *systematic review and *telemedicine","21",2

Methods: we undertook a systematic review of related literature by searching electronic bibliographic databases and identifying studies published from january 1, 2000, to november 30, 2017. The search was restricted to studies published in english, results from adult patients, and evaluation of home telemedicine programs implemented in the united states. Summarized telemedicine costs per unit of outcome measures were reported. Results: twelve studies were eligible for our review. The overall annual cost of providing home-based telemedicine varied substantially depending on specific chronic conditions, ranging from usd1,352 for heart failure to usd206,718 for congestive heart failure (chf), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), and diabetes as a whole. The estimated cost per-patient-visit ranged from usd24 for cancer to usd39 for chf, copd, or chronic wound care. Conclusions: the costs of home-based telemedicine programs varied substantially by program components, disease type, equipment used, and services provided. All the selected studies indicated that home telemedicine programs reduced care costs, although detailed cost data were either incomplete or not presented in detail. A comprehensive analysis of the cost of home-based telemedicine programs and their determinants is still required before the cost efficiency of these programs can be better understood, which becomes crucial for these programs to be more widely adopted and reimbursed.","English","Chronic disease and Costs and Home-based and Telemedicine","34",2

The objective of this research is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine interventions in various specialty areas. Methods: the cochrane library and centre for review and dissemination were searched up to february 2013 using mesh. Studies that compared any kind of telemedicine with any other routine care technique and used cost per health utility unit's outcomes were included. Results: twenty-one articles were included. According to the included studies, it seems that using telemedicine in cardiology can be effective and cost-effective enough but pre-hospital telemedicine diagnostics program are likely to have little impact on acute myocardial infarction fatality. In pulmonary, telemedicine can be a cost-effective strategy for delivering outpatient pulmonary care to rural populations which have limited access to specialized services, but telemedicine is not cost- effective in asthma and airways cancer. In ophthalmology, especially in the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, the use of telemedicine is a cost-effective tool. In dermatology, telemedicine is not cost-effective enough in comparison of conventional cares. In other fields such as physical activity and diet, eating disorder, tele-icu, psychotherapy for depression and telemedicine on ships, telemedicine can be used as a cost-effective tool for treatments or cares. Conclusion: most of the included studies confirmed that telemedicine is cost-effective for applying in major medical fields such as cardiology; but in dermatology, papers could not confirm the positive capability of telemedicine.","eng","Economics and Review and Telemedicine","31",1

Dr accounts for approximately 15-17% of all cases of total blindness in the usa and europe. Telemedicine is a new intervention for dr screening, however, there is not enough evidence to support its cost-effectiveness. The aim of this study is to review the most recent published literature on economic evaluations of telemedicine in dr screening and summarize the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of this technology. Methods: a systematic search of pubmed, embase and google scholar for relevant articles published between january 2010 and january 2020. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) recruited subjects with either type 1, type 2 diabetes (2) evaluated telemedicine technology (3) patients underwent primary screening for dr (4) compared a telemedicine-based intervention with standard care (5) performed an economic evaluation or provided sufficient data for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the technology used. Results: of 2238 articles screened, seven studies were included. Four of the studies were conducted in developed countries: the united states, singapore and two studies in canada. Three studies were conducted in developing countries: india, brazil and south africa. The patient populations in all studies were diabetic patients over the age of 18, previously not screened for dr. All seven studies used a telemedicine program which included capturing a retinal image and subsequently transmitting it to an ocular imaging center to assess the severity of dr. All studies compared telemedicine to a standard screening method for dr, including the option of no screening as standard of care. Although telemedicine requires initial and maintenance costs, it has the potential to provide significant cost savings by increasing patients' working ability, increasing independent living ability, increasing quality of life and reducing travel costs. Conclusions: diabetic retinopathy telemedicine technology has the potential to provide significant cost savings, especially in low-income populations and rural patients with high transportation costs.","eng","Cost-effectiveness and Diabetic retinopathy and Economic evaluation and Telemedicine screening and Teleophthalmology","18",1

In this study, we systematically reviewed the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of e-health interventions for depressive and anxiety symptoms and disorders in primary care. Methods: we searched medline, cochrane library, embase, and psychinfo until january 2018, for randomized controlled trials of e-health interventions for depression or anxiety in primary care. Two reviewers independently screened the identified publications, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the cochrane collaboration's tool. Results: out of 3617 publications, we included 14 that compared 33 treatments in 4183 participants. Overall, the methodological quality was poor to fair. The pooled effect size of e-health interventions was small (standardized mean differenceâ€¯=â€¯-0.19, 95%ci -0.31 to -0.06) for depression compared to control groups in the short-term, but this was maintained in the long-term (standardized mean differenceâ€¯=â€¯-0.22, 95%ci -0.35 to -0.09). Further analysis showed that e-health for depression had a small effect compared to care as usual and a moderate effect compared to waiting lists. One trial on anxiety showed no significant results. Four trials reported on cost-effectiveness. Limitations: the trials studied different types of e-health interventions and had several risks of bias. Moreover, only one study was included for anxiety. Conclusions: e-health interventions for depression have a small effect in primary care, with a moderate effect compared to waiting lists.

This systematic review examined cost reporting of telepsychiatry programmes for mental healthcare. Methods: we systematically searched electronic databases for studies reporting costs, including economic evaluations such as cost-effectiveness analyses, or costs of developing telepsychiatry programmes for clinical care of mental disorders. Included studies enrolled participants with mental disorders and involved telepsychiatry for depression, anxiety disorders, serious mental illnesses including schizophrenia spectrum disorders and bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, dementia or epilepsy. Results: twenty-six unique studies met inclusion criteria (17,967 participants), with most targeting depression (nâ€‰=â€‰7; 27%), general mental disorders and screening (nâ€‰=â€‰7; 27%), child mental health (nâ€‰=â€‰4; 15%) and geriatric mental health (nâ€‰=â€‰4; 15%). Nearly all studies (nâ€‰=â€‰25; 96%) compared telepsychiatry programme costs with either standard in-person consultation or usual care, with 15 (60%) reporting that telepsychiatry programmes were less expensive, and 8 (32%) showing telepsychiatry programmes were more expensive. Three studies reported cost-effectiveness analyses, favouring telepsychiatry programmes, but at highly elevated cost-effectiveness thresholds. Few studies reported costs of developing or delivering telepsychiatry programmes. Conclusion: costs of telepsychiatry programmes varied widely, with substantial heterogeneity in how costs were defined and reported. Some programmes cost less than in-person services while others cost more.

Many countries within the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) are investing in telemedicine initiatives, and a large and growing body of peer-reviewed studies on the topic has developed, as a consequence. Nonetheless, telemedicine is still not used at scale within the oecd. Seeking to provide a snapshot of the evidence on the use of telemedicine in the oecd, this umbrella review of systematic reviews summarizes findings on four areas of policy relevance: clinical and cost-effectiveness, patient experience, and implementation. Methods: this review followed a prior written, unregistered protocol. Four databases (pubmed/medline, crd, and cochrane library) were searched for systematic reviews or meta-analyses published between january 2014 and february 2019. Based on the inclusion criteria, 98 systematic reviews were selected for analysis. Due to substantial heterogeneity, a meta-analysis was not conducted. The quality of included reviews was assessed using the amstar 2 tool. Results: most reviews (n = 53) focused on effectiveness, followed by cost-effectiveness (n = 18), implementation (n = 17) and patient experience (n = 15). Eighty-three percent of clinical effectiveness reviews found telemedicine at least as effective as face-to-face care, and thirty-nine percent of cost-effectivenss reviews found telemedicine to be cost saving or cost-effective. Patients reported high acceptance of telemedicine and the most common barriers to implementation were usability and lack of reimbursement. However, the methodological quality of most reviews was low to critically low which limits generalizability and applicability of findings. Conclusion: this umbrella review finds that telemedicine interventions can improve glycemic control in diabetic patients; reduce mortality and hospitalization due to chronic heart failure; help patients manage pain and increase their physical activity; improve mental health, diet quality and nutrition; and reduce exacerbations associated with respiratory diseases like asthma. In certain disease and specialty areas, telemedicine may be a less effective way to deliver care. While there is evidence that telemedicine can be cost-effective, generalizability is hindered by poor quality and reporting standards. This umbrella review also finds that patients report high levels of acceptance and satisfaction with telemedicine interventions, but that important barriers to wider use remain.","English",NA,"15",2

Implementing decision support systems into clinical care is promised to improve quality of care and thereby yield substantial effects on reducing healthcare expenditure. In this article, we evaluate the economic impact of clinical decision support (cds) interventions based on electronic health records (ehr). Methods: we searched for studies published after 2014 using medline, central, web of science, ebsco, and tufts cea registry databases that encompass an economic evaluation or consider cost outcome measures of ehr based cds interventions. Thereupon, we identified best practice application areas and categorized the investigated interventions according to an existing taxonomy of front-end cds tools. Results and discussion: twenty-seven studies are investigated in this review. Of those, twenty-two studies indicate a reduction of healthcare expenditure after implementing an ehr based cds system, especially towards prevalent application areas, such as unnecessary laboratory testing, duplicate order entry, efficient transfusion practice, or reduction of antibiotic prescriptions. On the contrary, order facilitators and undiscovered malfunctions revealed to be threats and could lead to new cost drivers in healthcare. While high upfront and maintenance costs of cds systems are a worldwide implementation barrier, most studies do not consider implementation cost. Finally, four included economic evaluation studies report mixed monetary outcome results and thus highlight the importance of further high-quality economic evaluations for these cds systems. Conclusion: current research studies lack consideration of comparative cost-outcome metrics as well as detailed cost components in their analyses. Nonetheless, the positive economic impact of ehr based cds interventions is highly promising, especially with regard to reducing waste in healthcare.","English","Behavioral economics and Clinical decision support and Economic evaluation and Electronic health record","20",2

Digital health interventions facilitating interactions between a caregiver and a patient from a distance are a promising approach to improve patient adherence to lifestyle changes proposed by secondary prevention guidelines. Many of these interventions are not implemented in daily practice, even though efficacy has been shown. One of the reasons can be the lack of clear economic incentives for implementation. We propose to map all health economic evidence regarding digital health interventions for secondary stroke prevention. Summary: we performed a systematic search according to prisma-p guidelines and searched on pubmed, web of science, cochrane, and national institute for health research economic evaluation database.

Telemedicine is a tool for providing services for patients that are difficult to access or in need of immediate care. The aim of this study was to systematically review economic evaluation studies that compared telemedicine with usual care for cardiovascular patients. A systematic review was conducted according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines and related articles published up to december 2018 were searched in different databases (pubmed, embase, scopus, global health, google scholar, magiran, sid). The articles were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards statement checklist was used to qualitatively evaluate the papers. Overall, 20 articles were included in the study. The studies used quality-adjusted life years to measure outcomes. The highest and lowest values of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were $515,082 and $2099 that had been reported in the uk and new zealand, respectively. Most of the items of the checklist were reported and the quality of most of the studies was excellent and very good. According to the results, telemedicine improves the clinical outcomes and results in considerable saving in costs. Utilizing telemedicine concurrent with the usual care for service delivery is more cost-effective. The reviewed studies had been conducted in high-income countries, hence, it is essential to be cautious when generalizing the results and applying them in health systems policymaking.","English","*Cardiovascular disease and *Cost-benefit analysis and *Economic evaluation and *Systematic review and *Telemedicine","25",2

Fifty-four percent of authors systematically appraised included studies. In 10 percent of reports, the applicability of included studies was assessed. Involvement of two reviewers was rarely reported for the study selection (43 percent), data extraction (28 percent), and quality assessment (39 percent). Conclusions: the methods applied for sr-hes in hta and their reporting quality are very heterogeneous. Efforts toward a detailed, standardized guidance for the preparation of sr-hes definitely seem necessary. A general harmonization and improvement of the applied methodology would increase the value of sr-he for decision makers.","English","Economic evaluation and Health technology assessment and Reimbursement and Systematic review","34",2

Our systematic review aims to examine whether japan's telemedicine is cost-saving or cost-effective, examine the methodological rigorousness of the economic evaluations, and discuss future studies needed to improve telemedicine's financial sustainability. Methods: we searched five databases, including two japanese databases, to find peer-reviewed articles published between january 1, 2000 and december 31, 2014 in english and japanese that performed economic evaluations of japan's telemedicine programs. The methodological rigorousness of the economic analyses was assessed with a well-established checklist. We calculated the benefit-to-cost ratio (bcr) when a reviewed study reported related data but did not report the bcr. All cost values were adjusted to 2014 us dollars. Results: among the 17 articles identified, six studies reported on settings connecting physicians for specialist consultations, and eleven studies on settings connecting healthcare providers and patients at home. There are three cost-benefit analyses and three cost-minimization analyses. The remaining studies measured the benefit of telemedicine only, using medical expenditure saved or users' willingness-to-pay. There was substantial diversity in the methodological rigorousness. Studies on teledermatology and teleradiology indicated a favorable level of economic efficiency. Studies on telehomecare gave mixed results. One cost-benefit analysis on telehomecare indicated a low economic efficiency, partly due to public subsidy rules, e.g., a too short budget period. Conclusions: overall, telemedicine programs in japan were indicated to have a favorable level of economic efficiency.

However, lacking and unequal distribution of psychiatric medical personnel remains a barrier to its management. This review aims to introduce and evaluate the potential contribution of telepsychiatry to the management of ptsd based on published literature. Methods: original studies were obtained from pubmed, science direct, proquest, high wire, and elsevier clinical key databases. Results: a total of 125 articles were found, of which 15 articles (12 randomized controlled trials, 2 open trials and 1 pilot study) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A total of 991 subjects were found with a follow-up period ranging between 5 weeks and 18 months. Telepsychiatry is an innovative use of technology to aid the delivery of ptsd treatments in areas difficult to reach. The quality of care given by telepsychiatry both through video conferencing as well as web- and application-based is comparable to that of face-to-face therapy. Patient satisfaction, quality of doctor-patient relationship also remains high, with lower costs and shorter therapeutic time when compared to face-to-face therapy. Conclusion: various studies have shown that telepsychiatry is an effective solution for the management of ptsd. Studies have also reported that the quality of treatment through telepsychiatry is as effective as face-to-face therapy, with greater efficiency. Countries, especially those with a low patient-to-mental health professional ratio, should be encouraged to develop telepsychiatry systems to manage ptsd.","eng",NA,"42",1

With most dermatologists residing in metropolitan areas, teledermatology provides an apparent low-cost and convenient means of access for individuals living outside these areas. It is important that any proposed new addition to a health care system is assessed on the grounds of economic cost and effectiveness. Objective: to summarize and evaluate the current economic evidence comparing store-and-forward teledermatology (s&ftd) with conventional face-to-face care. Evidence review: search terms with appropriate amendments were used to identify s&ftd articles that included economic analysis. Six databases were searched, and title, abstract and full-text reviews were conducted by 2 researchers. References of all unique returned articles were searched by hand. The consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards (cheers) checklist was used to evaluate quality of the included articles. Findings: eleven articles were selected for inclusion, including 1 cost analysis, 4 cost-minimization analyses, 4 cost-effectiveness analyses, and 2 cost-utility analyses. Cheers scores ranged from 7 to 21 out of a possible 24 points, with a median score of 17. Conclusions and relevance: current evidence is sparse but suggests that s&ftd can be cost-effective. It appears to be cost-effective when used as a triage mechanism to reduce face-to-face appointment requirements. The cost-effectiveness of s&ftd increases when patients are required to travel farther distances to access dermatology services. Further economic research is required for the emerging s&ftd, which uses dermoscopes in combination with smartphone applications, as well as regarding the possibility and consequences of patients self-capturing and transmitting images.","eng",NA,"152",1

Methods: economic evaluation studies have been identified that compare teledermatology and traditional dermatological consultation during the period 1998-2015. We carried out a meta-analysis considering the work cost and the dermatologist's consultation time, analysing their differences. The opportunity cost represented by these differences in the dermatological remote consultation time was subsequently calculated based on the design of a cost/time variable. Results: it was not possible to meta-analyse the cost of the dermatologist's consultation due to insufficient standardized complete data. It was possible to carry out a meta-analysis of the consultation time, and three articles were selected (2945 patients). Teledermatology accounts for more time (7.54 min) than conventional consultation (p< 0.00001) and this difference is an opportunity cost of teledermatology of is an element of 29.25 per each remote consultation, with a unitary factor cost/time of 3.88 is an element of/minute. Conclusions: there is no unanimity in the literature regarding which of the two procedures is cheaper; further studies with the necessary standardized variables are required. In this meta-analysis, teledermatology takes more time than a conventional dermatology consultation, which leads to an opportunity cost, increasing the total cost of consultation.

During 7 years of follow-up, the incidence of diabetes diagnosis was 28.2 [95% confidence interval (ci) 24.4 to 32.7] per 1000 person-years in controls and 5.7 (95% ci 4.2 to 7.8) per 1000 person-years in bariatric surgery patients (adjusted hazard ratio was 0.20, 95% ci 0.13 to 0.30; pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). In 826 obese participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus who received bariatric surgery, the relative rate of diabetes remission, compared with controls, was 5.97 (95% ci 4.86 to 7.33; pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). There was a slight reduction in depression in the first 3 years following bariatric surgery that was not maintained. Incremental lifetime costs associated with bariatric surgery were â£15,258 (95% ci â£15,184 to â£15,330), including costs associated with bariatric surgical procedures of â£9164 per participant. Incremental quality-adjusted life-years (qalys) were 2.142 (95% ci 2.031 to 2.256) per participant. The estimated cost per qaly gained was â£7129 (95% ci â£6775 to â£7506). Estimates were similar across gender, age and deprivation subgroups. Limitations: intervention effects were derived from a randomised trial with generally short follow-up and non-randomised studies of longer duration. Conclusions: bariatric surgery is associated with increased immediate and long-term health-care costs but these are exceeded by expected health benefits to obese individuals with reduced onset of new diabetes, remission of existing diabetes and lower mortality. Diverse obese individuals have clear capacity to benefit from bariatric surgery at acceptable cost. Future work: future research should evaluate longer-term outcomes of currently used procedures, and ways of delivering these more efficiently and safely.

Objective: to evaluate new opportunities arising from linked ehrs for improving quality of care and outcomes for patients at risk of or with coronary disease across the patient journey. Design: epidemiological cohort, health informatics, health economics and ethnographic approaches were used. Setting: 230 nhs hospitals and 226 general practices in england and wales. Participants: up to 2â€‰million initially healthy adults, 100,000 people with stable coronary artery disease (scad) and up to 300,000 patients with acute coronary syndrome. Main outcome measures: quality of care, fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease (cvd) events. Data platform and methods: we created a novel research platform [clinical disease research using linked bespoke studies and electronic health records (caliber)] based on linkage of four major sources of ehr data in primary care and national registries. We carried out 33 complementary studies within the caliber framework. We developed a web-based clinical decision support system (cdss) in hospital chest pain clinics. We established a novel consented prognostic clinical cohort of scad patients. Results: caliber was successfully established as a valid research platform based on linked ehr data in nearly 2â€‰million adults with >â€‰600 ehr phenotypes implemented on the web portal (see https://caliberresearch.org/portal). Despite national guidance, key opportunities for investigation and treatment were missed across the patient journey, resulting in a worse prognosis for patients in the uk compared with patients in health systems in other countries. Our novel, contemporary, high-resolution studies showed heterogeneous associations for cvd risk factors across cvds. The cdss did not alter the decision-making behaviour of clinicians in chest pain clinics. Prognostic models using real-world data validly discriminated risk of death and events, and were used in cost-effectiveness decision models. Conclusions: emerging â€˜big dataâ€™ opportunities arising from the linkage of records at different stages of a patientâ€™s journey are vital to the generation of actionable insights into the diagnosis, risk stratification and cost-effective treatment of people at risk of, or with, cvd. Future work: the vast majority of nhs data remain inaccessible to research and this hampers efforts to improve efficiency and quality of care and to drive innovation. We propose three priority directions for further research. First, there is an urgent need to â€˜unlockâ€™ more detailed data within hospitals for the scale of the ukâ€™s 65â€‰million population. Second, there is a need for scaled approaches to using ehrs to design and carry out trials, and interpret the implementation of trial results. Third, large-scale, disease agnostic genetic and biological collections linked to such ehrs are required in order to deliver precision medicine and to innovate discovery.

Telemedicine can effectively transfer real-time ultrasound images via video-conferencing. We report the successful introduction of a fetal ultrasound telemedicine service linking a specialist fetal medicine (fm) centre and a remote obstetric unit. Methods over a four-year period from october 2015, all women referred for fm consultation from the obstetric unit were seen via telemedicine, excluding cases where invasive testing, intrauterine therapy or cardiac anomalies were anticipated. The outcomes measured included the indication for fm referral; scan duration and image and sound quality during the consultation. Women's perceptions of the telemedicine consultation and estimated costs to attend the fm centre were measured by a structured questionnaire completed following the first telemedicine appointment during the phase 1 of the project. Results overall, 297 women had a telemedicine consultation during phase 1 (pilot and evaluation) and phase 2 (embedding and adoption) of the project, which covered a 4 year period 34 women completed questionnaires during the phase 1 of the study. Travel to the telemedicine consultation took a median (range) time of 20 min (4150), in comparison to an estimated journey of 230 min (120,450) to the fm centre. On average, women would have spent approximately 28 pound to travel to the fm centre per visit. The overall costs for the woman and her partner/ friend to attend the fm centre was estimated to be 439 pound. Women were generally satisfied with the service and valued the opportunity to have a fm consultation locally. Conclusions we have demonstrated that a fetal ultrasound telemedicine service can be successfully introduced to provide fm ultrasound of sufficient quality to allow fetal diagnosis and specialist consultation with parents. Furthermore, the service is acceptable to parents, has shown a reduction in family costs and journey times.","English","Ultrasound; Pregnancy; Fetal medicine; Telemedicine","21",1

We aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of a hybrid er system in severe trauma patients without severe traumatic brain injury (tbi). Methods: we conducted a cost-utility analysis comparing the hybrid er system to the conventional er system from the perspective of the third-party healthcare payer in japan. A short-term decision tree and a long-term markov model using a lifetime time horizon were constructed to estimate quality-adjusted life years (qalys) and associated lifetime healthcare costs. Short-term mortality and healthcare costs were derived from medical records and claims data in a tertiary care hospital with a hybrid er. Long-term mortality and utilities were extrapolated from the literature. The willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $47,619 per qaly gained and the discount rate was 2%. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: the hybrid er system was associated with a gain of 1.03 qalys and an increment of $33,591 lifetime costs compared to the conventional er system, resulting in an icer of $32,522 per qaly gained. The icer was lower than the willingness-to-pay threshold if the odds ratio of 28-day mortality was < 0.66. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that the hybrid er system was cost-effective with a 79.3% probability.

Telemedicine was found to reduce outpatient visits and hospital admissions for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd). We performed a full economic evaluation of telemedicine interventions in patients with ibd, comparing the cost-utility of telemedicine vs standard care. Methods: we performed a randomized trial of 909 patients with ibd at 2 academic and 2 non-academic hospitals in the netherlands. Patients were randomly assigned to groups that received telemedicine (myibdcoach; n = 465) or standard outpatient care (n = 444) and followed for 12 months. Costs were measured from a societal perspective. Direct healthcare costs were based on actual resource use. Indirect costs comprised self-reported hours sick leave from work, intervention costs (annual license fee of (sic)40 per patient [$45]), and utility costs (assessed using eq5d). Cost-utility and uncertainty were estimated using the non-parametric bootstrapping method. Results: telemedicine resulted in lower mean annual costs of (sic)547/patient [$612] (95% ci, (sic)1029-2143 [$1150-2393]; mean costs of (sic)9481 [$10,587] for standard care and (sic)8924 [$9965] for telemedicine) without changing quality adjusted life years.

In particular, the usual task of outpatient care has shifted to the telemedicine format, bringing along all of its attendant advantages and gargantuan challenges. The authors sought to determine the responsiveness of this telemedicine setup to the needs of their disadvantaged patients and explored the application of bayesian inference to enhance the use of teleconsultation in daily clinical decision-making. Methods the authors used the following methods to assess the telemedicine setup used in a low-resource setting during the pandemic: 1) a cross-sectional survey of patients who participated in a medical consultation via telemedicine during the 16-week period from march 16, 2020, to july 15, 2020; 2) a cost-benefit analysis of the use of telemedicine by patients; and 3) a case illustration of a bayesian approach application unique to the teleconsultation scenario. Results of the 272 patient beneficiaries of telemedicine in a 16-week period, 57 responded to the survey. The survey responses regarding neurosurgical outpatient care through telemedicine yielded high ratings of utility for the patients and their caregivers. According to 64% of respondents, the affordability of the telemedicine setup also prevented them from borrowing money from others, among other adverse life events prevented. There were realized financial gains on the part of the patients in terms of cost savings and protection from further impoverishment. The benefit-cost ratio was 3.51 for the patients, signifying that the benefits outweighed the costs. An actual teleconsultation case vignette was reported that is meant to be instructive and contributory to the preparedness of the neurosurgeon on the provider end of the service delivery. Conclusions telemedicine holds promise as a viable and safe method for health service delivery during the pandemic. In the setting of a health system that is continually challenged by shortages of resources, this study shows that an effective telemedicine setup can come with high benefit- cost ratios and quality of care, along with the assurance of patient satisfaction. The potential for high-quality care can be enhanced by the inclusion of the bayesian framework to the basic toolkit of remote clinical assessment. When confronted with choices in terms of differential diagnosis and tests, the rigor of a simple application of the bayesian framework can minimize costs arising from uncertainties. https:// thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2020.9.Focus20695","English","pandemic; telemedicine; cost-benefit analysis; Bayesian framework; and clinical decision-making","49",1

To address this, three program models exist: (1) telepsychiatry; (2) psychiatrists traveling to underserved areas; and (3) reimbursing patients for travel to a psychiatrist. Evidence shows that telepsychiatry has comparable outcomes to in-person consultations. The objective of this study was to determine the cost difference between programs. Methods a cost-minimization analysis estimating cost per visit from a public healthcare payer economic costing perspective was conducted. Data on fixed and variable costs were obtained. Evidence-based assumptions were made where relevant. Base-case scenarios and a break-even analysis were completed, as well as deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, to explore the effects of parameter variability on program costs. Results costs per visit were lowest in telepsychiatry (cad$360) followed by traveling physicians (cad$558) and patient reimbursement (cad$620). Among the 100,000 monte carlo simulations, results showed telepsychiatry was the least costly program in 71.2% of the simulations, while the reimbursement and outreach programs were least costly in 15.1% and 13.7% of simulations, respectively. The break-even analysis found telepsychiatry was the least costly program after an annual patient visit threshold of approximately 76 visits (compared to traveling psychiatrists) and 126 visits (compared to reimbursed patients). Discussion our analyses support telepsychiatry as the least costly program. These results have important implications for program planning, including the prioritization of telepsychiatry, increased integration of telepsychiatry with other modalities of outreach psychiatry, and limiting use of the patient remuneration program to where medically necessary, to reduce overall cost.","English","Telemedicine; telepsychiatry; telehealth; cost analysis; cost and minimization","26",2

Findings in this cost minimization analysis incorporating personnel and teledermatology technology costs of 2098 patients referred to the dermatology department, teledermatology saved $140 per newly referred dermatology patient compared with a conventional dermatology care model. Meaning this study suggests that using teledermatology to triage and manage dermatology patients within a capitated health care system may be associated with significant cost savings. This cost minimization analysis compares the organization-wide cost of managing newly referred dermatology patients within a teledermatology triage system vs a conventional dermatology care model. Importance teledermatology (td) enables remote triage and management of dermatology patients. Previous analyses of td systems have demonstrated improved access to care but an inconsistent fiscal impact. Objective to compare the organizationwide cost of managing newly referred dermatology patients within a td triage system vs a conventional dermatology care model at the zuckerberg san francisco general hospital and trauma center (hereafter referred to as the zsfg) in california. Design, setting, and participants a retrospective cost minimization analysis was conducted of 2098 patients referred to the dermatology department at the zsfg between june 1 and december 31, 2017. Intervention implementation of the td triage system in january 2015. Main outcomes and measures the main outcome was mean cost to the health care organization to manage newly referred dermatology patients with or without td triage. To estimate costs, decision-tree models were constructed to characterize possible care paths with td triage and within a conventional dermatology care model. Costs associated with primary care visits, dermatology visits, and td visits were then applied to the decision-tree models to estimate the mean cost of managing patients following each care path for 6 months. The mean cost for each visit type incorporated personnel costs, with the mean cost per td consultation also incorporating software implementation and maintenance costs. Finally, zsfg patient data were applied within the models to evaluate branch probabilities, enabling calculation of mean cost per patient within each model. Results the analysis captured 2098 patients (1154 men [55.0%]; mean [sd] age, 53.4 [16.8] years), with 1099 (52.4%) having medi-cal insurance and 879 (41.9%) identifying as non-white. In the decision-tree model with td triage, the mean (sd) cost per patient to the health care organization was $559.84 ($319.29). In the decision-tree model for conventional dermatology care, the mean (sd) cost per patient was $699.96 ($390.24). Therefore, the td model demonstrated a statistically significant mean (se) cost savings of $140.12 ($11.01) per patient. Given an annual dermatology referral volume of 3150 patients, the analysis estimates an annual savings of $441 378. Conclusions and relevance implementation of a td triage system within the dermatology department at the zsfg was associated with cost savings, suggesting that managed health care settings may experience significant cost savings from using td to triage and manage patients.","English",NA,"157",1

Although there are scarce generalizable data on the value of health apps given their nascency and diverse use cases, it is possible to estimate the economic value of the clinical improvement they bring to patients using a quality-adjusted life-year (qaly)-based approach and generalized values from existing literature. Objective: this paper aims to provide a patient-centered framework for assessing the economic value of the clinical benefits delivered by digital health apps. Methods: we proposed a model based upon 5 levers: country-specific monetary value of a qaly, qalys lost due to the condition, engagement rate of app users, average effect size of the app's health impact, and duration of the app's impact before remission. Results: using 2 digital health apps from the united states and united kingdom as examples, we explored how this model could generate country-specific estimates of the economic value of the clinical benefits of health apps. Conclusions: this new framework can help drive research priorities for digital health by elucidating the factors that influence the economic value.","English","value; digital health; apps; payment models","7",1

In order to promote mental health, a series of programs have been promulgated by the chinese government. However, economic evaluations of such programs are lacking. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate an economic model to assess the cost and health outcomes of the lean (lay health supporters, e-platform, award, and integration) program, and to perform an economic evaluation of lean versus the nationwide community-based mental health program that provides free antipsychotic medications. Methods: a cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis of the lean intervention will be performed. A markov model will be developed, validated and used to assess and compare the costs and outcomes for the lean intervention versus nationwide community-based mental health program. The calculated sample size is 258 participants for the analysis. A societal perspective will be applied with the time horizon of 1-year after the termination of the lean program. The cost-utility will be measured primarily using quality adjusted life years and the cost-effectiveness will be measured using number of relapses and number of re-hospitalizations avoided 6-month after the intervention. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be conducted for the analysis of uncertainty. Discussion: if proven cost-effective, this study will contribute to the nationwide implementation of the program, not only for schizophrenia but for all kind of severe mental disorders. Markov model developed as part of the study will benefit potential researchers in analyzing cost-effectiveness of other programs.

The security of d2d-based m-health applications requires attention due to the delicacy of the data treated in the collection, transmission, and storage of information on patients, whose devices must be adequately authenticated. However, traditional authentication and key agreement schemes are not suitable for d2d scenarios, since they might expose patients to security vulnerabilities and lead to an excessive use of resources. This article proposes a secure and lightweight scheme based on shamir secret sharing for the mutual authentication of m-health devices in relay-assisted d2d communications, which provides security robustness and reduces resources (energy, processing) consumption.

Our study aims to examine associations between work-related ict exposure (i.e. Ict use or digital work intensification), physical health, mental health and work ability (wa). We examine whether these associations are modified by socio-economic position (sep). Methods we analysed cross-sectional data from 3180 participants (born in 1959 and 1965) in wave 3 of the representative german lida cohort study. We performed hierarchical multiple regression to assess the distinct associations of ict use and digital work intensification with mental and physical health and wa. We stratified analyses by sep and controlled for age, sex, and digital affinity. Results 92% of participants reported ict use at work. Almost 20% reported high levels of digital work intensification, while a similar proportion did not experience digital work intensification. In bivariate analyses, ict use by itself was not significantly associated with mental health or wa in the total sample or when stratified. Digital work intensification displayed negative associations with mental health and wa. In hierarchical multiple regressions, digital work intensification showed consistently negative associations with mental health and work ability of similar strength across sep. Conclusion our results suggest that ict use, per se, does not negatively impact older workers. Digital work intensification may be associated with worse mental health and work ability. Research on health and social implications of work-related ict should differentiate patterns of ict exposure and assess modifications by sep to better gauge the ambiguous effects of ict.","English","Technostress; Digital divide; Ageing workers; Job requirement level; and Occupational status; Workplace well-being",NA,1

Imtecho was developed as a job aid for accredited social health activists (ashas) and staff of primary health centers to increase coverage of maternal, neonatal, and child health care. Objective: in this study, we assessed the incremental cost per life years saved as a result of the imtecho intervention as compared to routine maternal, neonatal, and child health care programs. Methods: a two-arm, parallel, stratified cluster randomized trial with 11 clusters (primary health centers) randomly allocated to the intervention (280 ashas, n=2,34,134) and control (281 ashas, n=2,42,809) arms was initiated in 2015 in a predominantly tribal and rural community of gujarat. A system of surveillance assessed all live births and infant deaths in the intervention and control areas. All costs, including those required during the start-up and implementation phases, were estimated from a program perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated by dividing the incremental cost of the intervention with the number of deaths averted to estimate the cost per infant death averted. This was further analyzed to estimate the cost per life-years saved for the purpose of comparability. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to account for parameter uncertainties. Results: out of a total of 5754 live births (3014 in the intervention arm, 2740 in the control arm) reported in the study area, per protocol analysis showed that the implementation of imtecho resulted in saving 11 infant deaths per 1000 live births in the study area at an annual incremental cost of us $163,841, which is equivalent to us $54,360 per 1000 live births. Overall, imtecho is a cost-effective intervention from a program perspective at an incremental cost of us $74 per life-years saved or us $5057 per death averted. In a realistic environment with district scale-up, the program is expected to become even more cost-effective. Conclusions: overall, the findings of our study strongly suggest that the mhealth intervention as part of the imtecho program is cost-effective and should be considered for replication elsewhere in india.","English","mHealth; cost-effectiveness; life-years saved; India; ASHA","8",1

Telemonitoring (tm) has been shown to improve all-cause mortality and hospitalization rates in patients with hf. The medly program is a tm intervention integrated as standard of care at a large canadian academic hospital for ambulatory patients with hf that has been found to improve patient outcomes. However, the cost-effectiveness of the medly program is yet to be determined. Objective: this study aims to conduct a cost-utility analysis of the medly program compared with the standard of care for hf in ontario, canada, from the perspective of the public health care payer. Methods: using a microsimulation model, individual patient data were simulated over a 25-year time horizon to compare the costs and quality-adjusted life years (qalys) between the medly program and standard care for patients with hf treated in the ambulatory care setting. Data were sourced from a medly program evaluation study and literature to inform model parameters, such as medly's effectiveness in reducing mortality and hospitalizations, health care and intervention costs, and model transition probabilities. Scenario analyses were conducted in relation to hf severity and tm deployment models. One-way deterministic effectiveness analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to explore the impact on the results of uncertainty in model parameters. Results: the medly program was associated with an average total cost of can $102,508 (us $77,626) per patient and total qalys of 5.51 per patient compared with the average cost of can $97,497 (us $73,831) and qalys of 4.95 per patient in the standard care group. This led to an incremental cost of can $5011 (us $3794) and incremental qaly of 0.566, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of can $8850 (us $6701)/qaly. Cost-effectiveness improved in relation to patients with advanced hf and with deployment models in which patients used their own equipment. Baseline and alternative scenarios consistently showed probabilities of cost-effectiveness greater than 85% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of can $50,000 (us $37,718). Although the results showed some sensitivity to assumptions about effectiveness parameters, the intervention was found to remain cost-effective. Conclusions: the medly program for patients with hf is cost-effective compared with standard care using commonly reported willingness-to-pay thresholds. This study provides evidence for decision makers on the use of tm for hf, supports the use of a nurse-led model of tm that embeds clinically validated algorithms, and informs the use of economic modeling for future evaluations of early-stage health informatics technology.","English","cost utility analysis; cost effectiveness; telemedicine; heart failure; and microsimulation; mobile phone","22",1

Patients with af could benefit from screening through mobile health (mhealth) devices. Thus, an early diagnosis is possible with mhealth devices, and the risk for stroke can be markedly reduced by using anticoagulation therapy. Objective: the aim of this work was to assess the cost-effectiveness of algorithm-based screening for af with the aid of photoplethysmography wrist-worn mhealth devices. Even if prevented strokes and prevented deaths from stroke are the most relevant patient outcomes, direct costs were defined as the primary outcome. Methods: a monte carlo simulation was conducted based on a developed state-transition model; 30,000 patients for each cha2ds2-vasc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age >= 75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke, vascular disease, age 65-74 years, sex category [female]) score from 1 to 9 were simulated. The first simulation served to estimate the economic burden of af without the use of mhealth devices. The second simulation served to simulate the economic burden of af with the use of mhealth devices. Afterwards, the groups were compared in terms of costs, prevented strokes, and deaths from strokes. Results: the cha2ds2-vasc score as well as the electrocardiography (ecg) confirmation rate had the biggest impact on costs as well as number of strokes. The higher the risk score, the lower were the costs per prevented stroke. Higher ecg confirmation rates intensified this effect. The effect was not seen in groups with lower risk scores. Over 10 years, the use of mhealth (assuming a 75% ecg confirmation rate) resulted in additional costs ((sic)1=us $1.12) of (sic)441, (sic)567, (sic)536, (sic)520, (sic)606, (sic)625, (sic)623,(sic)692, and (sic)847 per patient for a cha(2)ds(2)-vasc score of 1 to 9, respectively. The number of prevented strokes tended to be higher in groups with high risk for stroke. Higher ecg confirmation rates led to higher numbers of prevented strokes. The use of mhealth (assuming a 75% ecg confirmation rate) resulted in 25 (7), -68 (-54), 98 (-5), 266 (182), 346 (271), 642 (440), 722 (599), 1111 (815), and 1116 (928) prevented strokes (fatal) for cha2ds2-vasc score of 1 to 9, respectively. Higher device accuracy in terms of sensitivity led to even more prevented fatal strokes. Conclusions: the use of mhealth devices to screen for af leads to increased costs but also a reduction in the incidence of stroke. In particular, in patients with high cha(2)ds(2)-vasc scores, the risk for stroke and death from stroke can be markedly reduced.","English","mHealth; atrial fibrillation; screening devices; strokes; and cost-effectiveness; photoplethysmography","8",1

We used time-driven activity-based costing to evaluate the change in resource use associated with transitioning to telemedicine in a radiation oncology department. Methods and materials: using a patient undergoing 28-fraction treatment as an example, process maps for traditional in person and telemedicine-based workflows consisting of discrete steps were created. Physicians/physicists/dosimetrists and nurses were assumed to work remotely 3 days and 1 day per week, respectively. Mapping was informed by interviews and surveys of personnel, with cost estimates obtained from the department's financial officer. Results: transitioning to telemedicine reduced provider costs by $586 compared with traditional workflow: $47 at consultation, $280 during treatment planning, $237 during on-treatment visits, and $22 during the follow-up visit. Overall, cost savings were $347 for space/equipment and $239 for personnel.

However, gaps remain in screening and treatment. Methods and results: general practitioners/nurses at practices in rural australia (n= 8) screened eligible patients (>= 65 years of age without af) using a smartphone ecg during practice visits. ehealth tools included electronic prompts, guideline-based electronic decision support, and regular data reports.

Oral anticoagulant treatment rates for patients with cha(2)ds(2)-va >= 2 were 82% (screen detected) versus 74% (preexisting af)(p= ns), similar to metropolitan and nonrandomized control practices. The incremental cost- effectiveness ratio for population-based screening was au$16 578 per quality-adjusted life year gained and au$84 383 per stroke prevented compared with no screening. National implementation would prevent 147 strokes per year. Increasing the proportion screened to 75% would prevent 177 additional strokes per year. Conclusions: an af screening program in rural practices, supported by ehealth tools, screened 34% of eligible patients and was cost- effective. Oral anticoagulant treatment rates were relatively high at baseline, trending upward during the study. Increasing the proportion screened would prevent many more strokes with minimal incremental cost-effectiveness ratio change. ehealth tools, including data reports, may be a valuable addition to future programs.","English","cost-effectiveness; digital health; general practice; primary care; and rural; stroke prevention","9",1

Results the range estimated from this study, 27,923-52,247 (2017 rmb) (central estimate 37,446) per daly averted or 47-88% of gdp per capita (central estimate 63%), shows that a cost per daly averted cost-effectiveness threshold that reflects health opportunity costs is below 1 x gdp per capita. Conclusion our results suggest that the current cost-effectiveness threshold used in china is too high; continuing to use it risks decisions that reduce overall population health.","English",NA,"38",1

We compared the costs of delivering a speech treatment via in-person consultation versus telerehabilitation. Methods we used data from a non-inferiority randomised controlled trial delivering the lee silverman voice treatment (lsvt loud (r)), where patients with dysarthria associated with pd were assigned to either the urban in-person group (n = 16) or the urban online group (n = 15), supplemented with a non-randomised group (regional online;n = 21). We compared costs over a one-month treatment period from a health-system perspective and a patient perspective.

Methods:this study is a prospective cohort analysis in six teleed networks operating in 65 hospitals in 11 states across the united states. Each submitted uniform data on all teleed encounters for a 26-month period to a data co-ordinating center. Averted transfers were identified if an encounter met specific criteria. Cost savings from averted transfers were estimated from hospital-specific costs of transferred patients. Results:a total of 4,324 teleed encounters were reported. Excluding patients who died, 1,934 (46.2%) were transferred to another inpatient facility. Records of the remaining 2,248 teleed patients were examined and 882 (39.2% of nontransfers; 20.4% of all teleed cases) teleed patients met the criteria for an averted transfer. Of the averted transfer cases, 53.3% were admitted to the local inpatient facility, and 43.5% were discharged. Patients who averted transfer had lower levels of severity and less billed services than those who were transferred. Transport savings for averted transfers were estimated to total $1,074,663 annually across the six teleed networks. Average estimated transport savings were $2,673 for each averted transfer. Conclusions:in a large cohort of teleed cases, 39% of nontransfer cases were averted transfers (20% of all teleed cases). Importantly, 43% of these patients were routinely discharged rather than being transferred. Averted transfers saved on average $2,673 in avoidable transport costs per patient, with 63.6% of these cost savings accruing to public insurance.","English","emergency medicine; telemedicine; teletrauma; telehealth; policy",NA,1

Despite a growing literature on economic evaluation of digital mental health interventions (dmhis), including several systematic reviews, there is no conclusive evidence regarding their cost-effectiveness. This paper reviews the methodology used to determine their cost-effectiveness and assesses whether this meets the requirements for decision-making. In doing so we consider the challenges specific to the economic evaluation of dmhis, and identify where consensus and possible further research is warranted. Methods a systematic review was conducted to identify all economic evaluations of dmhis published between 1997 and december 2018. The searches included databases of published and unpublished research, reference lists and citations of all included studies, forward citations on all identified protocols and conference abstracts, and contacting authors researchers in the field. The identified studies were critiqued against a published set of requirements for decision-making in healthcare, identifying methodological challenges and areas where consensus is required. Results the review identified 67 papers evaluating dmhis. The majority of the evaluations were conducted alongside trials, failing to capture all relevant available evidence and comparators, and long-term impact of mental health disorders. The identified interventions are complex and heterogeneous. As a result, there are a number of challenges specific to their evaluation, including estimation of all costs and outcomes, conditional on analysis viewpoint, and identification of relevant comparators. A taxonomy for dmhis may be required to inform what interventions can reasonably be pooled and compared. Conclusions this study represents the first attempt to understand the appropriateness of the methodologies used to evaluate the value for money of dmhis, helping work towards consensus and methods' harmonisation on these complex interventions.","English",NA,"19",1

While many htas are published in peer-reviewed journals, many are considered proprietary and their attributes remain confidential, limiting researchers' ability to answer these questions. Models for economic evaluations like cost-effectiveness analyses (ceas) synthesize a wide range of evidence, are often statistically and mathematically sophisticated, and require untestable assumptions. As such, there is nearly universal agreement among researchers that enhancing transparency is an important issue in health economic modeling. However, the definition of transparency and guidelines for its implementation vary. Model registration combined with a linked database of model-based economic evaluations has been proposed as a solution, whereby registered models and their accompanying technical and nontechnical documentation are sourced into a single publicly-available repository, ideally in a standardized format to ensure consistent and complete representation of features, code, data sources, results, validation exercises, and policy recommendations. When such a repository is ultimately created, modelers will not have to reinvent the wheel for every new drug launched or new treatment pathway. These more open and transparent approaches will have substantial implications for model accuracy, reliability, and validity, improving trust and healthcare decision-makers.","English","Health Technology Assessment; Economic Modeling; Cost-Effectiveness; and Transparency","9",1

It has been suggested that interventions should focus more on committed approaches of self-care, such as electronic health techniques. Objective: this study aimed to provide evidence to understand the financial consequences of implementing the ""do cardiac health: advanced new generation ecosystem"" (do change 2) intervention, which was evaluated in a multisite randomized controlled trial to change the health behavior of patients with cardiovascular disease. Methods: the cost-effectiveness analysis of the do change 2 intervention was performed with the monitoring and assessment framework for the european innovation partnership on active and healthy ageing tool, based on a markov model of five health states. The following two types of costs were considered for both study groups: (1) health care costs (ie, costs associated with the time spent by health care professionals on service provision, including consultations, and associated unplanned hospitalizations, etc) and (2) societal costs (ie, costs attributed to the time spent by patients and informal caregivers on care activities). Results: the do change 2 intervention was less costly in spain (incremental cost was -(sic)2514.90) and more costly in the netherlands and taiwan (incremental costs were (sic)1373.59 and (sic)1062.54, respectively). Compared with treatment as usual, the effectiveness of the do change 2 program in terms of an increase in quality-adjusted life-year gains was slightly higher in the netherlands and lower in spain and taiwan.

Furthermore, usage aboard u.s. Navy ships has been limited in scope. This has direct costs associated with the medical care rendered and indirect costs such as difficulty navigating medical systems, access to records, and appropriate follow-up. Telemedicine has expanded access to otolaryngologic care where coverage has been deficient, with overall costs that are not well defined. This study aims to demonstrate the ability of consult management aboard a deployed u.s. Navy ship and to determine the direct costs associated with the use of an hipaa-compliant, store-and-forward telemedicine system available to overseas medical providers to obtain specialty consultation at a tertiary care military treatment facility. Study design:retrospective case series. Methods:we reviewed consults submitted through the system from february 2018 to may 2018. Consult management was performed remotely by a deployed otolaryngologist in various locations underway and in port in the pacific rim. The direct cost associated with each consult was compared with the cost had the patient been treated in the host nation. Results:during the deployment, there were eight consults submitted and directed to a neurotologist/skull base surgeon for an opinion. The estimated cost for treating these patients overseas was $124,037, while the estimated cost of retaining the patients in the military health system was $27,330. Extrapolated to a 12-month period, the cost savings of this program could be over $400,000. Conclusions:telemedicine consultation has the ability to be initiated and managed remotely-expanding access to subspecialty physicians by service members stationed around the world.

The aim of this study was to assess the cost-utility of oncokompas compared with care as usual (cau) among cancer survivors. Methods survivors were randomly allocated to the intervention or control group. Direct (non-)medical, indirect non-medical costs, and hrqol were measured at 3- and 6-month follow-up, using imta medical consumption and productivity costs and the euroqol-5d questionnaires. Mean cumulative costs and quality-adjusted life-years (qalys) were compared between both groups. Results in total, 625 survivors were randomized into intervention (n = 320) or control group (n = 305). Base case analysis showed that incremental costs from a societal perspective were - euro163 (95% ci, - 665 to 326), and incremental qalys were 0.0017 (95% ci, - 0.0121 to 0.0155) in the intervention group compared with those in the control group. The probability that, compared with cau, oncokompas is more effective was 60%, less costly 73%, and both more effective and less costly 47%. Sensitivity analyses showed that incremental costs vary between - euro40 and euro69, and incremental qalys vary between - 0.0023 and - 0.0057. Conclusion oncokompas is likely to be equally effective on utilities, and not more expensive than cau, and will therefore contribute to sustainable cancer survivorship care in a (cost-)effective manner. Implications for cancer survivors oncokompas seems to improve hrqol and reduces the burden of several tumour-specific symptoms, while costs from a societal perspective are similar to cau.","English","Cancer survivorship; Supportive care; Self-management; Quality of life; and eHealth; Cost-utility","15",1

This paper applies this emerging perspective to the particular case of vaccination against serogroup b meningococcal disease (menb). We explore key issues involved in health technology assessments of menb vaccination, which have led to pronounced heterogeneity in evaluation methods and recommendation outcomes across countries such as france, germany, the us, and the uk. Accounting for typically neglected sources of socioeconomic benefit could potentially impact recommendation and reimbursement decisions. We propose a taxonomy of such benefits built around four dimensions: (i) internalized health benefits, (ii) internalized non-health benefits, (iii) externalized health benefits, and (iv) externalized non-health benefits. This approach offers a systematic, comprehensive evaluation framework that can be used in future assessment of menb vaccines as well as other health technologies.","English","vaccination; immunization; meningococcal; meningitis B; health and technology assessments; cost effectiveness","8",1

Objective: this study aimed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of usual care with and without telemonitoring-guided management in patients with chf discharged from the hospital, from the perspective of us health care providers. Methods: a lifelong markov model was designed to estimate outcomes of (1) usual care alone for all postdischarge patients with chf (new york heart association [nyha] class i-iv), (2) usual care and telemonitoring for all postdischarge patients with chf, (3) usual care for all postdischarge patients with chf and telemonitoring for patients with nyha class iii to iv, and (4) usual care for all postdischarge patients with chf plus telemonitoring for patients with nyha class ii to iv. Model inputs were derived from the literature and public data. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of model. The primary outcomes were total direct medical cost, quality-adjusted life years (qalys), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (icer). Results: in the base case analysis, universal telemonitoring group gained the highest qalys (6.2967 qalys), followed by the telemonitoring for nyha class ii to iv group (6.2960 qalys), the telemonitoring for nyha class iii to iv group (6.2450 qalys), and the universal usual care group (6.1530 qalys). Icers of the telemonitoring for nyha class iii to iv group (us $35,393 per qaly) and the telemonitoring for nyha class ii to iv group (us $38,261 per qaly) were lower than the icer of the universal telemonitoring group (us $100,458 per qaly). One-way sensitivity analysis identified five critical parameters: odds ratio of hospitalization for telemonitoring versus usual care, hazard ratio of all-cause mortality for telemonitoring versus usual care, chf hospitalization cost and monthly outpatient costs for nyha class i, and chf hospitalization cost for nyha class ii. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, probabilities of the universal telemonitoring, telemonitoring for nyha class ii to iv, telemonitoring for nyha class iii to iv, and universal usual care groups to be accepted as cost-effective at us $50,000 per qaly were 2.76%, 76.31%, 18.6%, and 2.33%, respectively.

Materials and methods: patients were enrolled in a prospective cohort study comparing postoperative virtual and in-person visits during a 4-month period in 2018. Appointment status and time metrics were tracked. The primary outcome was the safety of virtual visits, assessed by comparing the number of additional in-person visits, emergency department encounters and hospital readmissions. Secondary outcomes included the family assessment of the encounter and associated costs. After each visit families were prompted to complete a survey that assessed missed work/school and direct costs. Opportunity cost was estimated using reported missed work time, average national hourly wage and visit duration. Results: overall 107 virtual and 100 in-person postoperative visits were completed. There was no difference in patient characteristics, appointment compliance or clinical outcomes between the cohorts. Travel and waiting for care accounted for 98.4% of the total time spent for an in-person visit. With the virtual visit significantly less work and school were missed by parents and children, respectively. The opportunity costs associated with an in-person visit were computed at $23.75 per minute of face time with a physician, compared to $1.14 for a virtual visit. Conclusions: for pediatric postoperative care virtual visits are associated with shorter wait times, decreased missed work and school, and clinical outcomes similar to those of in-person visits.

Objective to evaluate the association between annual health care costs of patients with type 2 diabetes and the use of an electronic health record system with a disease management program (ehr/dmp) in general practice. Design, setting, and participants this retrospective cohort study examined patients with type 2 diabetes in denmark between january 1, 2008, and december 31, 2014, who attended practices that either used an ehr/dmp at a high level or never used the disease management system. An ehr/dmp system was rolled out across general practices in denmark beginning in 2011 and was discontinued in 2014. Data were analyzed between march 2019 and march 2020. Main outcomes and measures the main outcome was total health care costs, and the secondary outcomes were primary care, medication, nonhospital specialist, and hospital (total, outpatient, inpatient, and emergency) costs. Regression models were used to estimate ehr/dmp-associated percentage differences in patients' annual health care treatment costs across health care treatment categories. All models included general practice-level fixed effects and patient-level controls. Two-part models examined robustness of estimated associations for hospital cost categories. Results of 33 970 patients included in the analysis, 15 953 (8016 [50.2%] male; mean [sd] age, 59.9 [13.3] years) attended 244 general practices that used the system at a high level, and 18 017 (9291 [51.6%] male; mean [sd] age, 60.0 [12.9] years) attended 344 general practices that had never used the system.

Methods: assessments published by the icer between december 2014 and april 2019 were reviewed. Data on the assessment, intervention, results from cost-effectiveness analyses, and council members' votes were extracted. Voting data were examined using bar charts and radar plots. Spearman's correlations between the number of votes for other benefits and contextual considerations were estimated. Two case studies (tisagenlecleucel and voretigene neparvovec) explored the relationship between different aspects of value and the vote. Results: thirty-one icer assessments were reviewed, which included 51 value votes and 17 votes on other benefits and contextual considerations. On average, interventions with lower cost-effectiveness ratios received a higher proportion of high and intermediate value votes; however, there was heterogeneity across assessments. Of other benefits or disadvantages, having a novel mechanism of action received the most votes (n = 138), and reducing health disparities received the fewest (n = 24). Of contextual considerations, treating a condition that has a severe impact on length and quality of life received the most votes (n = 164).

We used a cost-minimisation analysis to evaluate the potential savings of two deep learning approaches as compared with the current human assessment: a semi-automated deep learning model as a triage filter before secondary human assessment; and a fully automated deep learning model without human assessment. Methods in this economic analysis modelling study, using 39 006 consecutive patients with diabetes in a national diabetic retinopathy screening programme in singapore in 2015, we used a decision tree model and treeage pro to compare the actual cost of screening this cohort with human graders against the simulated cost for semi-automated and fully automated screening models. Model parameters included diabetic retinopathy prevalence rates, diabetic retinopathy screening costs under each screening model, cost of medical consultation, and diagnostic performance (ie, sensitivity and specificity). The primary outcome was total cost for each screening model. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were done to gauge the sensitivity of the results to key model assumptions. Findings from the health system perspective, the semi-automated screening model was the least expensive of the three models, at us$62 per patient per year. The fully automated model was $66 per patient per year, and the human assessment model was $77 per patient per year. The savings to the singapore health system associated with switching to the semi-automated model are estimated to be $489 000, which is roughly 20% of the current annual screening cost. By 2050, singapore is projected to have 1 million people with diabetes; at this time, the estimated annual savings would be $15 million.

The objective of the current study was to characterize the cdi rate by device type, risk factors for infection and healthcare costs from a large u.s. health insurer perspective. Materials and methods: a retrospective analysis of a large u.s. health insurer database identified commercial and medicare advantage with part d (mapd) members >= 18 years with >= 1 claim for a cardiac implantable electronic device (cied) procedure between 01 october 2011 and 31 october 2015. Cieds included pacemakers (ipg), implantable cardioverter defibrillators (icds), and cardiac resynchronization therapy - pacemakers without (crt-p) and with defibrillation (crt-d). Probabilities of cdi through one-year post implant were estimated using the kaplan-meier method. A regression model with stepwise variable selection was used to select risk factors associated with cdis. Results: a total of 63,406 patients were included with an overall cdi rate of 1.28% (1.0% de novo and 1.74% replacement devices), varying by device type: ipg = 0.91%; icd = 1.63%; crt-p = 1.50%; crt-d = 2.22%.

To address the challenge of limited health service cost data, this study used econometric methods to identify determinants of cost and estimate unit costs for each indian state. Methods using data from 81 facilities in six states, models were developed for inpatient and outpatient services at primary and secondary level public health facilities. A best-fit unit cost function was identified using guided stepwise regression and combined with data on health service infrastructure and utilisation to predict state-level unit costs. Results health service utilisation had the greatest influence on unit cost, while number of beds, facility level and the state were also good predictors. For district hospitals, predicted cost per inpatient admission ranged from 1028 (313-3429) indian rupees (inr) to 4499 (1451-14,159) inr and cost per outpatient visit ranged from 91 (44-196) inr to 657 (339-1337) inr, across the states. For community healthcare centres and primary healthcare centres, cost per admission ranged from 412 (148-1151) inr to 3677 (1359-10,055) inr and cost per outpatient visit ranged from 96 (50-187) inr to 429 (217-844) inr. Conclusion this is the first time cost estimates for inpatient admissions and outpatient visits for all states have been estimated using standardised data. The model demonstrates the usefulness of such an approach in the indian context to help inform health technology assessment, budgeting and forecasting, as well as differential pricing, and could be applied to similar country contexts where cost data are limited.","English",NA,"18",1

For the period until the end of 2019, a total of 52,198 visits were recorded. Objective: to analyze the differential costs between telemedicine and usual care in a semi-urban environment. Methodology: a cost-minimization evaluation, including direct and indirect costs from a societal perspective, distinguishing healthcare and user's costs, was carried out over a three-month period. Results: telemedicine saved euro 780,397 over the period analyzed. A differential cost favorable to telemedicine of about euro 15 per visit was observed, with the patient being the largest beneficiary of this saving (by 85%) in terms of shorter waiting times and travel costs. From the healthcare system perspective, moving the time spent in a hospital care consultation to primary care is efficient in terms of the total time devoted per patient. In social terms and in this context, telemedicine is more efficient than usual care.

Fifty patients were assigned to receive either telemonitoring (tm; n = 25) or conventional monitoring (cm; n = 25) and were followed up for 12 months after the implantation. A cost-utility analysis was performed in terms of additional costs per additional quality-adjusted life year (qaly) attained from the perspectives of the norwegian national healthcare system and patients and their caregivers.

Although there is growing interest in using robots in telemedicine, there are few economic evaluation studies of robot-based telemedicine. Introduction: robots developed for use in telemedicine consultation services may help address the challenges that result from korean physicians' efforts to support patients in vietnam. We perform a cost-benefit analysis to assess the economic feasibility of a robot-based telemedicine consultation system compared with traditional face-to-face outpatient services. Methods: a cost-benefit analysis is performed of a robot-based telemedicine consultation system between s hospital in korea and h hospital in vietnam. The threshold was calculated as the point at which the cost of providing telemedicine consultation equals the cost of providing the same service using traditional methods. Results: the annual cost of a robot-based telemedicine consultation system was estimated as 6,056.40 usd, whereas the annual benefit from replacing traditional outpatient services was estimated as 1,508.51 usd, resulting in a threshold point of 4.01 visits per year. Consequently, if the telemedicine consultation robot system replaces >4.01 physician visits per year, it is more economical than conventional face-to-face services. If the physician needs to stay longer, the threshold will be lower. Conclusions: as our results show, robot-based systems for telemedicine have economic value and can potentially offer a solution to the unmet health care needs among patients living in medically underdeveloped regions by providing proper and timely medical care.","English","telemedicine; e-Health; robot-based teleconsultation; economic and evaluation; cost-benefit","26",1

We used bootstrap methods to quantify the uncertainty around cost-effectiveness estimates. Health outcomes assessed in this analysis were gestational weight gain (gwg; kg), incidence of excessive gwg, quality-adjusted life years (qalys), and incidence of large-for-gestational-age (lga). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (icers) were calculated as cost per qaly gained, cost per kg of gwg avoided, cost per case of excessive gwg averted, and cost per case of lga averted. Results total mean cost including intervention and health care utilisation was euro3745 in the intervention group and euro3471 in the control group (mean difference euro274, p = 0.08). The icer was euro2914 per qaly gained. Assuming a ceiling ratio of euro45,000, the probability that the intervention was cost-effective based on qalys was 79%. Cost per kg of gwg avoided was euro209. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (ceac) for kg of gwg avoided reached a confidence level of 95% at euro905, indicating that if one is willing to pay a maximum of an additional euro905 per kg of gwg avoided, there is a 95% probability that the intervention is cost-effective.

Inpatient or full-day outpatient rehabilitation are some of the standard therapies. For sustainable rehabilitation, continuation of rehabilitation after discharge from a rehabilitation centre is vital. Besides medical exercise therapy (met), home-based physical exercise programmes are used. To monitor exercise quantity and quality, agt-reha, a health-enabling technology for home rehabilitation, has been developed and evaluated in a pilot study for technical feasibility and acceptance. To integrate the digital therapeutic agt-reha into regular healthcare processes, an efficacy evaluation is required. Methods and analysis agt-reha-wk is a prospective, monocentric, non-randomised, unblinded non-inferiority trial. Primary objective is to investigate whether agt-reha enhanced home-based exercise training is non-inferior to met as standard aftercare. Secondary objective is to compare the costs of both therapies. Efficacy as medical success (primary outcome) is examined with regard to ability to work, return to work and sustainability of training (secondary outcomes). The outcome measure for non-inferiority is shoulder function (pain and disability) assessed by the standardised shoulder pain and disability index (spadi).

Our study seeks to understand the effectiveness of physician-patient communication at telecamps with several salient characteristics: rural underprivileged patients, physicians in remote cities, and frugal telemedicine technology-specifically, videoconferencing-deployed in hospitals on wheels and appropriated by operators. We adopt a multiple-actor perspective, propose a decomposed affordance-effectivity framework, and combine variance and process perspectives to examine the phenomenon of interest. We collaborated with apollo hospitals, a leading hospital system in india, and collected multisource data from two major telecamps in rural south india. Based on an analysis of survey data from 216 telecamp participants through a variance perspective, we found support for the fit of patient-perceived media richness with two contingency factors-(1) disease diagnostic complexity and (2) patient healthcare needs fulfillment-in influencing patient satisfaction with teleconsultation. Based on an analysis of 46 sessions of teleconsultation video archives through a process perspective, we found that technology appropriation is realized through verbal and nonverbal communication events between patients and physicians, with on-site operators playing multiple roles that serve as ""compensatory user effectivity.""

Consequently, there is a development of a web-based electronic healthcare aimed at providing electronic health services in real time. In this way, through the implementation of the concept of electronic health, there is an exchange of health information among all stakeholders of the health organization, all with the aim of monitoring the health status of patients, timely intervention and adequate allocation of medical resources. Processing and sharing a large amount of health data in real time, with the constant need to maintain a high level of interoperability and scalability of network infrastructure, requires the highest possible level of security in accessing data, in order to reduce the misuse of health data. By using blockchain technology, the risk of misusing health information, asymmetry of information and the risk of increasing transaction costs are reduced in a very short time. Blockchain is a robust mathematical algorithm that can provide maximum security of the transaction using cryptographic methods. This type of technology is based on a distributed database that contains encrypted data that can not be changed or disturbed. For this reason, the application of this technology as a data integration tool is increasingly reflected in the electronic business of health organizations - electronic healthcare. Blockchain technology is especially used in information-intensive electronic healthcare records and medical applications, which ultimately results in reduced costs of providing health services, especially when it comes to system maintenance and security costs, interoperability and data redundancy. According to above mentioned cost- saving role of blockchain technology in processing, sharing and analyzing healthcare data, in this paper, there will be more to say about the positive economic impact of blockchain technology on electronic healthcare, especially in the case of estonia. This european country is a pioneer in creating, implementing and using the e-health concept as an integral part of health information system through its healthcare system, in order to increase efficiency of healthcare services.","English","Blockchain technology; data integrity; e-Health; health economics",NA,1

This article provides an overview of this new policy, which was implemented formally after a pilot program. In the fiscal year (fy) 2012, discussions on cost-effectiveness assessments were initiated in japan. After 7 years of deliberations, a cost-effectiveness assessment was implemented formally in april 2019. In japan, the cost-effectiveness analysis has been used to inform price adjustments of healthcare technologies, although it has not yet been used for decision making on insurance coverage. Selection criteria were established because not all drugs and medical devices could be evaluated owing to a shortage of experts. Exclusion criteria have also been applied to prevent access restriction. The scope of the evaluation's price adjustment target is limited to part of the product price. If the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (qaly) threshold falls below u5 million per qaly, the price adjustment rate changes stepwise according to the cost per qaly. In addition to price reduction, a priceraising scheme has also been implemented for scenarios where products are evaluated to be highly cost-effective and innovative. This article describes the first formally implemented hta system in japan. Although it is too early to make any conclusions about its effect, the japan-specific context makes this system unique. To fully understand the opportunities and challenges of the new system, it is vital that japan accumulates experience with this system and develops human resources in health economic evaluation.","English","Central Social Insurance Medical Council; cost-effectiveness analysis; and health technology assessment; Japan","23",1

The aim of our analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of a telemedicine-based intervention specifically in these patients, as compared to standard of care alone. Methods the insuficiencia cardiaca optimitzacio remota (icor) study was a single centre, randomised, controlled trial, designed to evaluate a telemedicine intervention added to an existing hospital/primary care multidisciplinary, integrated programme for chronic heart failure patients. 178 participants were randomised to telemedicine or usual care, and were followed for six months. For the present sub-analysis, only icor participants (n = 116) with left ventricular ejection fraction >= 40% were included. The primary study endpoint was the incidence of an acute non-fatal heart failure event, defined as a new episode of worsening of symptoms and signs consistent with acute heart failure requiring intravenous diuretic therapy.

This study explores the economic benefits of telemedicine for patients, in terms of cost and times savings, and its potential role in improving chronic disease outcomes. Methods: this retrospective cross-sectional study compared telemedicine services with hypothetical in-person consultations, with a focus on patient travel time and travel cost savings. A database containing teleconsultation visits (n = 25,182) conducted at health facilities in remote regions of afghanistan, pakistan, tajikistan, and the kyrgyz republic, was analyzed. A two-sample homoscedastic t test was used to determine differences between the two groups. A one-way sensitivity analysis was also conducted, presuming in-person teleconsultations at 90%, 75%, and 50%. Results: the study extracted data from 25,182 teleconsultation visits (12,814 males; 12,368 females). The cumulative patient savings through the program amounted to usd 9,175,132, and 1,876,146 h, or 213.1 years. A significant difference was seen between the two groups in terms of mean time savings (p-value <0.05), and a nearly significant difference was observed in terms of mean cost savings (p-value = 0.05). Conclusions: this study suggests that considerable economic benefits imparted to patients in low-resource settings of lmics via accessing telemedicine. Telemedicine has great potential to improve chronic disease outcomes in low-resource areas by reducing socioeconomic barriers related to cost and access, and increasing uptake of services, thereby enabling early intervention and long-term management.","English","telemedicine; chronic disease; telemedicine cost savings; telemedicine and time savings; teleconsultation network; economic evaluation of and telemedicine; telemedicine in LMICs; telemedicine user benefits","10",1

One aspect is their health-economic impact. While the process and methodology for pharmaceuticals is well-established, guidance for medical devices is sparse. Aim: to provide an overview of the health-economic aspect in current european hta guidelines concerning medical devices and identifying issues raised and potential improvements proposed in recent literature. Methodology: available guidelines by european agencies were each reviewed and summarized. To complement this, a full systematic review of current literature concerning potential improvements to existing hta practices for medical devices, from pubmed and embase, was conducted; the focus was on health economics. Authors could only review documents in english, french, or german. The systematic review yielded 518 unique articles concerning hta for medical devices, 32 of which were considered for full-text review after screening of all abstracts. Results: there is very limited consensus in-and mostly a complete lack of-guidance specific to medical devices in official hta guidelines, for both clinical and economic analyses. Twenty two of 41 european countries had published official hta guidance in english, french, or german. Among these only 4 (england, france, the netherlands, and sweden) dedicated a chapter or separate document to medical devices. In the literature, there is sufficient evidence to suggest medical devices need to be addressed separately from pharmaceuticals. However, mostly challenges are discussed rather than implementable solutions offered. We present the following set of frequently discussed issues and summarize any solutions that pertain to them: a weak evidence base, learning-curve effects, organizational impact, incremental innovation, diversity of devices, dynamic pricing, and transferability. We further combine reviewed information to suggest a set of possible best practices for health-economic assessment of medical devices. Conclusion: for greater efficiency in medical-device innovation, european agencies should look to (re-)address the specific requirements of medical devices in their hta guidelines. When both the health-economic and data requirements for the hta of medical devices are defined, the development of practical solutions will likely follow.","English","medical device; health-technology assessment; guidelines; health and economics; Europe; regulatory; systematic review","6",1

Nowadays, patients are expected to adopt an active role in managing their own health and healthcare. Oncokompas is an ehealth self-management application developed to support patients in finding optimal palliative care, tailored to their quality of life and personal preferences. A randomized controlled trial will be carried out to determine the efficacy and cost-utility of oncokompas compared to care as usual. Methods 136 adult patients with incurable lung, breast, colorectal and head and neck cancer, lymphoma and glioma, will be included. Eligible patients have no curative treatment options and a prognosis of at least three months. Patients will be randomly assigned to the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group directly has access to oncokompas alongside care as usual, while the waiting list control group receives care as usual and will have access to oncokompas after three months. The primary outcome measure is patient activation, which can be described as a patient's knowledge, skills and confidence to manage his or her own health and healthcare. Secondary outcome measures comprise self-efficacy, health-related quality of life, and costs. Measures will be assessed at baseline, two weeks after randomization, and three months after the baseline measurement.

The mobile health (mhealth) coaching program smarter pregnancy is an effective intervention to improve nutrition and lifestyle behaviors and pregnancy rates in (sub)fertile couples, including those who undergo ivf treatment. Therefore, we hypothesize that this mhealth program can also reduce health care costs associated with ivf treatment. Objective: this study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the mhealth coaching program smarter pregnancy and compare it to usual care in women of subfertile couples who start their first ivf cycle. Methods: this model-based cost-effectiveness analysis was performed on data from couples undergoing ivf treatment at the erasmus mc, university medical center rotterdam. A decision tree model was used to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (icer) of ongoing pregnancies and costs of use of the mhealth program as compared to usual care. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to consider the uncertainty surrounding the point estimates of the input parameters. Results: based on our model including 793 subfertile women undergoing ivf treatment, use of the mhealth program resulted in 86 additional pregnancies and saved (sic)270,000 compared to usual care after two ivf cycles, with an icer of -(sic)3050 (95% ci -3960 to -540) per additional pregnancy. The largest cost saving was caused by the avoided ivf treatment costs. Sensitivity analyses showed that the mhealth program needs to increase the ongoing pregnancy rate by at least 51% after two ivf cycles for cost saving. Conclusions: the mhealth coaching program smarter pregnancy is potentially cost saving for subfertile couples preceding their first ivf treatment. Implementation of this mhealth program in routine preconception care for subfertile couples should be seriously considered, given the relatively low costs and promising cost-effectiveness estimates.","English","preconception; subfertility; IVF treatment; pregnancy; and cost-effectiveness","7",1

Digital therapeutics (dtxs) delivering these interventions may provide benefits comparable to pharmacologic therapies, displacing medications for some patients. Objective: our objective was to estimate the economic impact of a digital behavioral intervention in type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) and hypertension (htn) and estimate the impact of clinical inertia on deprescribing medications. Methods: decision analytic models estimated health resource savings and cost effectiveness from a us commercial payer perspective. A 3-year time horizon was most relevant to the intervention and payer. Effectiveness of the dtx in improving clinical outcomes was based on cohort studies and published literature. Health resource utilization (hru), health state utilities, and costs were drawn from the literature with costs adjusted to 2018 dollars. Future costs and quality-adjusted life years (qalys) were discounted at 3%. Sensitivity analyses assessed uncertainty. Results: average hru savings ranged from $97 to $145 per patient per month, with higher potential benefits in t2dm. Cost-effectiveness acceptability analyses using a willingness-to-pay of $50,000/qaly indicated that the intervention would be cost effective at total 3-year program costs of $6468 and $6620 for t2dm and htn, respectively. Sensitivity analyses showed that reduced medication costs are a primary driver of potential hru savings, and the results were robust within values tested. A resistance to deprescribe medications when a patient's clinical outcomes improve can substantially reduce the estimated economic benefits. Our models rely on estimates of clinical effectiveness drawn from limited cohort studies with dtxs and cannot account for other disease management programs that may be implemented. Performance of dtxs in real-world settings is required to further validate their economic benefits. Conclusions: the dtxs studied may provide substantial cost savings, in part by reducing the use of conventional medications. Clinical inertia may limit the full cost savings of dtxs.","English","digital therapeutics; behavioral intervention; economic evaluation; and diabetes; hypertension","21",1

There are limited evidences on the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. This study was undertaken in maharashtra, a province, located in the western region of the country, to inform policy regarding the effectiveness of this programme. The objective was to estimate the unit cost of art services for pediatric hiv patients and examine the efficiency in the use of resource and treatment compliance resulting from telemedicine initiatives in pediatric hiv compared to usual art services. Methods we selected 6 art centers (3 from linked centers linked to pediatric hiv centre of excellence (pcoe) and 3 from non-linked centers) randomly from three high, middle and low art centers, categorized on the basis of case load in each arm. A bottom up costing methodology was adopted to understand the unit cost of services. Loss to follow up and timeliness of the visits were compared between the two arms and were linked to the cost. Results the average cost per-visit was inr 1803 in the linked centers and that for the non-linked centers was inr 3412. There has been 5 percentage point improvement in lost to follow-up in the linked centers compared to non-linked centers against a back-drop of a reduction in per-pediatric patient cost of inr 557. The linkage has resulted in increase in timeliness of the visits in linked centers compared to non-linked centers.

Telerehabilitation helps negate access issues and is efficacious in total knee and hip replacement patients. This study aims to compare the cost-effectiveness of a telerehabilitation programme delivered remotely into patients' homes versus traditional care for total hip replacement patients following hospital discharge. Methods: a cost-effectiveness (cost-utility) analysis was conducted from the perspective of a health service alongside a two-arm randomised controlled trial comparing telerehabilitation (n=35) with in-person care (n=35) following hospital discharge after total hip replacement. The primary analysis used an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to compare the cost per quality adjusted life year (qaly) accrued in the telerehabilitation group versus in-person control using costs and effects data from the randomised trial. A secondary analysis was conducted whereby the time accrued by patients attending rehabilitation sessions (including travel time) was considered the ""cost"" (i.e. a time burden), rather than cost from the health service perspective. Results: estimated mean differences in healthcare costs and qalys gained were detected but were not significant. The estimated mean (95%ci) difference in cost of telerehabilitation versus in-person was -$28.90 (-$96.37 to $40.45), favouring the telerehabilitation group. The estimated mean (95%ci) difference in qalys gained from telerehabilitation versus in-person was -0.0025 (-0.0227 to 0.0217). The estimated mean (95%ci) difference in time burden favoured less time burden for the telerehabilitation group (-4.21 (-4.69 to -3.74) hours). Discussion: telerehabilitation in the total hip replacement population incurred similar costs and yielded similar effects to traditional in-person care. Telerehabilitation significantly reduced the time burden for patients and carers. These findings are valuable for healthcare providers seeking to implement accessible patient-centred rehabilitation services.","English","Cost-effectiveness; home telecare; telehealth; telerehabilitation; and cost-utility",NA,1

Data were collected in 2016 from the u-m dent cost-benefit comparison of tangible and intangible factors associated with implementing a new ehr, using the total cost of ownership (tco) framework from educause. The tco framework assessed three factors: foundational (overarching aspects: three items), qualitative (intangibles: 56 items), and quantitative (actual costs). Stakeholders performed factor grading, and relative assessment scores were derived for each item as well as the overall factor.

This apparent paradox reflects a conventional practice of cost-effectiveness analysis that does not properly evaluate the opportunity costs of an intervention that imposes non-marginal costs on the healthcare system. Objective: taking the perspective of an exogenously resource constrained decision maker, this paper presents a framework by which concerns for affordability can be appropriately incorporated within cost-effectiveness analysis. Methods: a net benefit framework is proposed where health opportunity costs are estimated for each simulation iteration within each time period. The framework is applied to a hypothetical case study based on the recent experience of the english nhs with new hepatitis c drugs. Results: under the proposed framework, but not under conventional cost-effectiveness analysis, estimates of health opportunity costs differ between scenarios involving different profiles of budget impact even when their net present value, or expected value, are the same. Conclusions: the framework presented here reflects the importance of the scale of budget impacts along with their uncertainty distribution and time profile. In doing so it resolves issues with the conduct of conventional cost-effectiveness analysis where affordability concerns are not explicitly incorporated.","English","affordability; budget impact; cost-effectiveness analysis; opportunity and cost","22",1

The total reduction in passenger vehicle emission of environmental pollutants, including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitric oxides, and volatile organic compounds was 1632 kg, 42,867 g, 3160 g, and 4715 g, respectively, with a total of 194 gallons of gas saved from driving. Conclusions: utilization of telemedicine services reduces the travel distance, time, and costs for vascular surgery patients. Outpatient telemedicine programs may also provide environmental benefit through the reduction of greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions.","English",NA,"59",1

In this study, we use a population-based approach using electronic health record (ehr)-based algorithms to identify fh. We report the major adverse cardiovascular events, mortality, and cost of medical care associated with this diagnosis. Methods and results-in our 1.18 million ehr-eligible cohort, international classification of diseases, ninth revision (icd-9) code-defined hyperlipidemia was categorized into fh and non-fh groups using an ehr algorithm designed using the modified dutch lipid clinic network criteria. Major adverse cardiovascular events, mortality, and cost of medical care were analyzed. A priori associated variables/confounders were used for multivariate analyses using binary logistic regression and linear regression with propensity score-based weighted methods as appropriate. Ehr fh was identified in 32 613 individuals, which was 2.7% of the 1.18 million ehr cohort and 13.7% of 237 903 patients with hyperlipidemia. Fh had higher rates of myocardial infarction (14.77% versus 8.33%; p<0.0001), heart failure (11.82% versus 10.50%; p<0.0001), and, after adjusting for traditional risk factors, significantly correlated to a composite major adverse cardiovascular events variable (odds ratio, 4.02; 95% ci, 3.88-4.16; p<0.0001), mortality (odds ratio, 1.20; ci, 1.15-1.26; p<0.0001), and higher total revenue per-year (incidence rate ratio, 1.30; 95% ci, 1.28-1.33; p<0.0001). Conclusions-ehr-based algorithms discovered a disproportionately high prevalence of fh in our medical cohort, which was associated with worse outcomes and higher costs of medical care. This data-driven approach allows for a more precise method to identify traditionally high-risk groups within large populations allowing for targeted prevention and therapeutic strategies.","English","familial hypercholesterolemia; major adverse cardiovascular events; and mortality; subclinical atherosclerosis risk factor; subclinical familial and hypercholesterolemia","8",1

A low-vision optometry telerehabilitation evaluation is a thorough assessment of patient's functional vision. Following each low-vision optometry telerehabilitation evaluation is a low-vision telerehabilitation initial assessment with a blind rehabilitation therapist. Our objective was to estimate the acceptance and practicality of low-vision telerehabilitation and investigate the travel cost and time savings. Methods: utilizing google maps (tm), round-trip travel mileage and travel time can be estimated between the veteran's home and the buffalo veterans affairs (va) and compared with the round-trip mileage and travel time between the veteran's home and local community-based outpatient center (cboc) or local va for low-vision telerehabilitation services. The difference is the savings in travel miles and time. Cost saving can be calculated by multiplying difference in travel miles by cost per mile. Results: veterans who chose not to schedule face-to-face low-vision rehabilitation at the buffalo va due to an average round-trip travel distance of 151 miles scheduled a low-vision telerehabilitation at a local cboc or local va with an average round-trip travel distance of 29 miles. Adding low-vision telerehabilitation services from fiscal year (fy) 13 to fy 17 resulted in a 24% increase in low-vision patient care. The median saving of travel miles for rural veterans was 122 miles per veteran, and the median saving of travel time was 2.09 h per veteran. Overall, the median saving of the travel cost was $65.29 per veteran. Conclusions: this study shows and supports low-vision telerehabilitation as an accepted, practical, time-saving, and cost-saving alternative option to traditional face-to-face consultations with a low-vision optometrist and blind rehabilitation therapist.","English","telemedicine; telehealth; education; ophthalmology; rehabilitation","25",1

Design this is a health economic evaluation alongside a three-arm randomised controlled trial from a societal perspective. Assessments were conducted at baseline, 9 weeks and 6 months after randomisation. Setting participants were recruited through online and offline strategies and in collaboration with a health insurance company. Participants 302 adults (>= 18 years, pain for at least 6 months) were randomly allocated to one of the three groups (actonpain(guided), actonpain(unguided), cg).

However, both the cost-effectiveness of these strategies compared with usual care, and whether the additional benefit of telemonitoring compared with self-monitoring alone could be considered value for money, are unknown. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of physician titration of antihypertensive medication using self-monitored blood pressure, with or without telemonitoring, to make hypertension treatment decisions in primary care compared with usual care. A markov patient-level simulation model was developed taking a uk health service/personal social services perspective. The model adopted a lifetime time horizon with 6-month time cycles. At a willingness to pay of 20000 pound per quality-adjusted life year, self-monitoring plus telemonitoring was the most cost-effective strategy (17424 pound per quality-adjusted life year gained) compared with usual care or self-monitoring alone (posting the results to the physician). However, deterministic sensitivity analysis showed that self-monitoring alone became the most cost-effective option when changing key assumptions around long-term effectiveness and time horizon. Overall, probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that self-monitoring regardless of transmission modality was likely to be cost-effective compared with usual care (89% probability of cost-effectiveness at 20000 pound/quality-adjusted life year), with high uncertainty as to whether telemonitoring or self-monitoring alone was the most cost-effective option.

We prospectively evaluated the cost of a synchronous audio-video on-demand telemedicine taking into account both what patients would have done instead of the telemedicine visit as well as the care patients received after the visit. Materials and methods: we conducted a prospective observational study of patients who received care from an on-demand telemedicine program. At the time of the visit, we surveyed patients about the alternative care that would have been requested, if they had not done the telemedicine visit. We also obtained information following the visit about what further care was received. Using cost data derived from the literature we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the cost impact of the on-demand telemedicine visit. Results: there were 650 patients enrolled with a mean age of 37 who were 68% female; 74% had their care concerns resolved on the telemedicine visit; only 16% would have ""done nothing"" if they had not done the telemedicine visit, representing possible new utilization. Net cost savings per telemedicine visit was calculated to range from $19-$121 per visit. Conclusions: in our on-demand telemedicine program, we found the majority of health concerns could be resolved in a single consultation and new utilization was infrequent.

Introduction: this study involved a cost minimization analysis for installation of a teleradiology system in the hokkaido prefecture of japan. Conditions under which system utilization is cost-efficient and system utilization is effective for cost reduction were analyzed. Materials and methods: a cost minimization analysis was conducted using three geospatial points of 50, 100, and 200 km from sapporo city, the prefectural capital of hokkaido, assuming a central imaging diagnosis center in sapporo. The analysis was conducted from the standpoint of both patients and requesting hospitals. Results: from the patient's standpoint, a cost reduction effect was observed at all three distances from system installation. In contrast, from the hospital's standpoint, a cost reduction effect was found only when teleradiology examination was conducted from a distance of at least 100 km from sapporo. Discussion: results show that the cost reduction effect for patients increased as the travel distance increased. Although the teleradiology service is beneficial for a wide range of patients, the financial burden on requesting hospitals is significant. Conclusions: the following conditions were found necessary to reduce the requesting hospital's financial burden: the hospital should be far from the imaging diagnosis center, an inexpensive system is to be selected, and the system needs to be utilized continuously.","English","telemedicine; telehealth; teleradiology; policy; information management; and business administration","25",1

Two hundred sixty telemedicine encounters would be needed to offset the initial cost, and 537 encounters would be needed to surpass revenue of the conventional clinic. Conclusion a real-time telemedicine otolaryngology clinic provides significant cost savings for both patients and the peripheral healthcare system. This pilot study supports telemedicine as a cost-effective approach to providing general otolaryngology care to rural patients.

In this study, we explore the social gradients in overall healthcare and social care costs, as well as in the disaggregated costs by cost category. Study design: we calculated the social gradient in health and social care costs by cost category using a linked electronic health record data set for kent, a county in south east england. We performed a cross-sectional analysis on a sample of 323,401 residents in kent older than 55 years to assess the impact of neighbourhood deprivation on mean annual per capita costs in 2016/17. Methods: patient-level costs were estimated from activity data for the financial year 2016/17 andwere extracted alongside key patient characteristics. Mean costs were calculated for each area deprivation quintile based on the index of multiple deprivation of the neighbourhood (lower super output area) in which the patient lived. Cost subcategories were analysed across primary care, secondary care, social care, community care and mental health. Results: the mean annual per capita cost increased with deprivation across each deprivation quintile, with a cost of 1205 pound in the most affluent quintile, compared with 1623 pound in the most deprived quintile, a 35% cost increase. Social gradients were found across all cost subcategories. Conclusions: health inequalities in the population older than 55 years in kent are associated with health and social care costs of 109m pound, equivalent to 15% of the estimated total expenditure in this age group. Such significant costs suggest that appropriate interventions to reduce socioeconomic inequalities have the potential to substantially improve population health and, depending on how much investment they require, may even result in cost savings.

This study explored: 1) the average time to complete common nursing tasks documented in the electronic health record, 2) nursing-related tasks that remain undocumented, 3) the association between observation data and actual nursing documentation, and 4) considerations for model development and report design to be used for activity based cost accounting in nursing. Methods this was an observational study completed on acute care inpatient nursing units at a large academic medical center. During a five-week period, 63 nurses from 25 units were observed for over 250 h. Results nearly 60% of the observed nursing activities did not fit into categories readily available in, and easily abstracted from, the electronic health record. The undocumented activities accounted for over half of the observation tasks and equated to nearly 130 h, in which over 40 h were spent on the activity of documentation/charting itself. Furthermore, nearly 36 h were spent on communication, followed by 13.5 h on monitoring/surveillance, two critical tasks in nursing which cannot be overlooked. Conclusions using the electronic health record for cost accounting in nursing is a novel approach. In addition to the electronic health record, supplementary sources of data must be included to accurately capture nursing work and associated costs. Findings and lessons learned from this study will be used to guide future work and develop a model that determines the cost of nursing care and improved value in hospitalized patients.

Objective: the aim of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of an orthopedic videoconferencing service between the university hospital of north norway and a regional medical center in a remote community located 148 km away. Methods: an economic evaluation based on a randomized controlled trial of 389 patients (559 consultations) referred to the hospital for an orthopedic outpatient consultation was conducted. The intervention group (199 patients) was randomized to receive video-assisted remote orthopedic consultations (302 consultations), while the control group (190 patients) received standard care in outpatient consultation at the hospital (257 consultations). A societal perspective was adopted for calculating costs. Health outcomes were measured as quality-adjusted life years (qalys) gained. Resource use and health outcomes were collected alongside the trial at baseline and at 12 months follow-up using questionnaires, patient charts, and consultation records. These were valued using externally collected data on unit costs and qaly weights. An extended sensitivity analysis was conducted to address the robustness of the results. Results: this study showed that using videoconferencing for orthopedic consultations in the remote clinic costs less than standard outpatient consultations at the specialist hospital, as long as the total number of patient consultations exceeds 151 per year. For a total workload of 300 consultations per year, the annual cost savings amounted to (sic)18,616. If costs were calculated from a health sector perspective, rather than a societal perspective, the number of consultations needed to break even was 183. Conclusions: this study showed that providing video-assisted orthopedic consultations to a remote clinic in northern norway, rather than having patients travel to the specialist hospital for consultations, is cost-effective from both a societal and health sector perspective.

Limited evidence exists on the value for money of mobile health (mhealth) programs in low-and middle-income countries. Objective: this study aims to forecast the incremental cost-effectiveness of the mobile technology for community health (motech) initiative at scale across 170 districts in ghana. Methods: motech's ""client data application"" allows frontline health workers to digitize service delivery information and track the care of patients. Motech's other main component, the ""mobile midwife,"" sends automated educational voice messages to mobile phones of pregnant and postpartum women. We measured program costs and consequences of scaling up motech over a 10-year analytic time horizon. Economic costs were estimated from informant interviews and financial records. Health effects were modeled using the lives saved tool with data from an independent evaluation of changes in key services coverage observed in gomoa west district. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were presented overall and for each year of implementation. Uncertainty analyses assessed the robustness of results to changes in key parameters. Results: motech was scaled in clusters over a 3-year period to reach 78.7% (170/216) of ghana's districts. Sustaining the program would cost us $17,618 on average annually per district. Over 10 years, motech could potentially save an estimated 59,906 lives at a total cost of us $32 million. The incremental cost per disability-adjusted life year averted ranged from us $174 in the first year to us $6.54 in the tenth year of implementation and us $20.94 (95% ci us $20.34-$ 21.55) over 10 years. Uncertainty analyses suggested that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was most sensitive to changes in health effects, followed by personnel time. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggested that motech had a 100% probability of being cost-effective above a willingness-to-pay threshold of us $50. Conclusions: this is the first study to estimate the value for money of the supply-and demand-side of an mhealth initiative. The adoption of motech to improve mnch service delivery and uptake represents good value for money in ghana and should be considered for expansion.

A lifetime time horizon and health care payer perspective were used. Achieved bp, future cardiovascular risks, and attendant consequences on quality-adjusted life years and canadian dollar costs were modeled. Bp telemonitoring was assumed to occur for 3 months, then quarterly. Life tables were used to determine overall mortality, adjusted by cardiovascular disease mortality. Relative efficacies of intervention-associated bp lowering, resource use, and costs were obtained from canadian published literature. Reduction in systolic bp of 9.7 mmhg was used in the base case; subsequently, robust sensitivity analyses were conducted. The results showed that, over the lifetime horizon, telemonitoring with case management led to net health care savings of $1929 canadian and increased per-patient qalys by 0.83. These findings were robust to sensitivity analysis, with the intervention remaining dominant or highly cost-effective. Increasing telemonitoring costs by 50% still resulted in the intervention being dominant; if the costs of telemonitoring plus case management were 2-3 times base case cost, incremental cost-effectiveness was $1200-$4700 per quality-adjusted life year gained.

The method utilizes a sensor controller (sc) within the iot sn, which is capable of performing medical checks supporting a broad coverage of medical uses. A communication protocol has been developed for data and command exchange among sc, local gateways, and physicians' or patients' mobile devices (tablets, smart phones). The sc supports moving average window (maw) and principle component analysis (pca) filtering algorithms to capture data from the attached low-cost body sensors of different sampling profiles. Significant extensions in sn's portability is achieved through energy consumption minimization based on the idle time gaps between sensors' activations. Sn's components are either deactivated or set to low activity operation during these idle intervals. A medical case study is presented and the evaluated results show that the proposed sn can be incorporated into e-health platforms since it achieves comparable accuracy to its certified and high-cost commercial counterparts.","English","e-health environment; sensor applications; patient monitoring; medical and IoT sensor nodes; low-power; accuracy; IoT platforms","8",1

The traditional process to produce a custom-made foot orthotic device is to use manual casting of foot shape and physical moulding of orthoses materials. Parts of this process can be undertaken using digital tools rather than manual processes with potential advantages. The aim of this trial was to provide the first comparison of a traditional orthoses supply chain to a digital supply chain over a 6month period. The trial used plantar pressure, health status, and health service time and cost data to compare the two supply chains.methodsfifty-seven participants with diabetes were randomly allocated to each supply chain. Plantar pressure data and health status (eq5d, icecap) was assessed at point of supply and at six-months. The costs for orthoses and clinical services accessed by participants were assessed over the 6months of the trial. Primary outcomes were: reduction in peak plantar pressure at the site of highest pressure, assessed for non-inferiority to current care. Secondary outcomes were: reduction in plantar pressure at foot regions identified as at risk (>200kpa), cost-consequence analysis (supply chain, clinician time, service use) and health status.resultsat point of supply pressure reduction for the digital supply chain was non-inferior to a predefined margin and superior (p<0.1) to the traditional supply chain, but both supply chains were inferior to the margin after 6months. Custom-made orthoses significantly reduced pressure for at risk regions compared to a flat control (traditional -13.85%, digital -20.52%).

The current approach to diagnosing pneumonia involves the use of the integrated management of childhood illness (imci), which contains guidelines for observing high risk signs for early detection. However, due to lack of point of care monitoring devices, these observations are either inaccurate, invalid or costly. Furthermore, several mhealth solutions do not detect this disease and only provide guidelines. In this work, we propose a new low-cost system that captures biomedical data as recommended by doctors to identify pneumonia. Among the system components, the hub unit is the critical element that collects biometric data from sensors, and samples it. Afterwords, the data is transmitted in real time via bluetooth low energy (ble) radio to a mobile android-based device. The hub design is based on nrf52832 - nordic semiconductors microcontroller due to its low cost and highspeed adc (i.e., saadc). The time complexity of all software digital processing and band-pass filtering techniques for the hub is equal to o(1). The design is validated by examining the linear relationship between the applied and calculated frequencies (r-2 = 1). Our real-world analysis reveals that there are more than 70% correlations for the spo2 data, and more than 90 % correlations for the rr data. This is captured between the gold standard measurements and our device. To further justify the accuracy, the two methods used to demonstrate that they are within the line of agreements (loa) in terms of spo2, based on bland altman analysis (i.e., lower and upper line of agreements (loas) are equal to and 2:0; respectively). Furthermore, the accuracy in terms of rr is mostly within and 3:6 loas. In comparison to the biosignalplux hub - plux wireless biosignals s.a., the battery life of this new design lasts for seven days compared to twenty-four hours for biosignalplux. The new hub is compact and can be packaged in a small case. Furthermore, the hub costs $10 usd in comparison to the biosignalplux and the contec device that range from approximately $1,000 to $6,000 usd.","English","Community-acquired pneumonia; Children; Respiration rate; SpO2; mHealth; and Point-of-care testing",NA,1

Proceeding from a basic concept underpinning economic evaluation, opportunity cost, this study aims to explain how different approaches to economics diverge quite dramatically in their ideas of what constitutes appropriate valuation, both in principle and practice. Because the concept of opportunity cost does not inherently specify how valuation should be undertaken or specify how appropriate any economic value framework (evf) might be, the three main economics-based approaches to providing evidence about value for health technology assessment are described. Methods. This paper describes how the three main evfs-namely, the extra-welfarist, welfarist, and classical-are most typically understood, applied, and promoted. It then provides clarification and assessment of related concepts and terminology. Results. Although evfs differ, certain underlying characteristics of valuation were identified as fundamental to all approaches to economic evaluation in practice. The study also suggests that some of the rhetoric and terms employed in relation to the extra-welfarist approach are not wholly justified and, further, that only the welfarist approach ensures adherence to welfare-economic principles. Finally, deliberative analysis, especially when connected with a classical economic approach, can serve as a useful supplement to other analytical approaches. Conclusions. All three approaches to economic evaluation have something to offer assessment processes, but they all display limitations too. Therefore, the author concludes that the language of economic evaluation should be used with sufficient humility to prevent overselling of evfs, especially with regard to the qualities of evidence they provide for priority setting processes.","English","Costs and cost analyses; Priorities; Health; Health; Technology and assessment; Health","35",1

The knees are the lower limb joints exposed to major tension during human locomotion, presenting higher risk of a wider range of possible disorders. The devices used to monitor human joints should be comfortable and not restrain patients' movement, while maintaining their resolution and accuracy. Most of current measurement techniques are based on electronic devices, which are often not adequate for demanding environments, such as the context of physical rehabilitation. We propose an e-health sensing solution to dynamically monitor human knee angles during gait, using low-cost intrinsic fabry-perot interferometers optical fiber sensors (fpi-ofs). To the best of our knowledge, no previous efforts have reported the use of fpi sensors for such dynamic monitoring. The overall sensor consists of an optical fiber containing the fpi microcavity, which is embedded along the longitudinal direction of a kinesio tape (k-tape), and placed along the knee rotation axis. Since the k-tape has great adhesion to the skin, the fpi sensor is kept at the knee rotation axis, without restricting the user's movements. During the knee flexion/extension, the k-tape extends/compresses accordingly, resulting in the modulation of the reflected spectrum by the fpi-ofs. Several calibration and performance tests have been performed. Their results show the reliability and accuracy of the proposed solution, with sensibilities values of 53.8 +/- 2.4 pm/degrees.","English","Fabry-Perot interferometric sensors; gait analysis; knee angle and monitoring; optical fiber fuse effect; eHealth architectures","11028",1

Methods participants were randomised to receive 12 weeks of telerehabilitation or centre-based rehabilitation. Remote-cr provided individualised exercise prescription, real-time exercise monitoring/coaching and theory-based behavioural strategies via a bespoke telerehabilitation platform; cbexcr provided individualised exercise prescription and coaching via established rehabilitation clinics. Outcomes assessed at baseline, 12 and/or 24 weeks included maximal oxygen uptake (vo(2)max, primary) modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, exercise adherence, motivation, health-related quality of life and programme delivery, hospital service utilisation and medication costs. The primary hypothesis was a non-inferior between-group difference in vo(2)max at 12 weeks (inferiority margin=-1.25 ml/kg/min); inferiority margins were not set for secondary outcomes. Results 162 participants (mean 61 +/- 12.7 years, 86% men) were randomised.

Telemedicine (tm) holds great promise in relieving these disparities. We have prospectively measured patientcentered data surrounding a tm care program at a federal health system and compared these with usual care (uc). Methods: veterans with previously established ia were enrolled in tm follow-up. Data collected longitudinally before and after entering the program included routine assessment of patient index data 3 (rapid-3), out-of-pocket visit costs and distances traveled, and patient satisfaction instruments. Demographics were recorded. Similar data were collected on a convenience sample of concurrent ia patients receiving uc. Results: eighty-five patients were observed, including 25 receiving tm care and 60 receiving uc. No differences in demographics, satisfaction scores, or rapid-3 were noted at baseline between groups. Univariate linear regression of cross-sectional baseline data suggests satisfaction instrument scores were predicted by rapid-3 (beta = -0.64/ 10 points, p = 0.01), as well as distance (beta = -0.19/ 100 miles, p = 0.02) and cost (beta = -0.37/$ 100, p = 0.05). A multivariate model indicates both distance (beta = -0.17/ 100 miles, p = 0.02) and rapid-3 (beta = -0.47/ 10 points, p < 0.03) were predictors for visit satisfaction. In longitudinal follow-up via tm, satisfaction (delta= 0.03, p = 0.94) and rapid-3 (delta = 0.27, p = 0.89) remained similar to baseline among tm patients, whereas distance traveled (delta= -384.8 miles/ visit, p < 0.01) and visit costs (delta = -$ 113.8/ visit, p < 0.01) were reduced. Conclusions: patient-reported outcomes for care delivered via tm were similar to uc, with significant cost and distance savings.

Determining which types of recruitment strategies to use presents a challenge for many researchers. Objective: the aim of this study was to present an analysis of the time-efficiency and cost-effectiveness of recruitment strategies for ehealth clinical trials, and it describes a framework for cost-effective trial recruitment. Methods: participants were recruited for one of 5 ehealth trials of interventions for common mental health conditions. A multipronged recruitment approach was used, including digital (eg, social media and craigslist), research registry-based, print (eg, flyers and posters on public transportation), clinic-based (eg, a general internal medicine clinic within an academic medical center and a large nonprofit health care organization), a market research recruitment firm, and traditional media strategies (eg, newspaper and television coverage in response to press releases). The time costs and fees for each recruitment method were calculated, and the participant yield on recruitment costs was calculated by dividing the number of enrolled participants by the total cost for each method. Results: a total of 777 participants were enrolled across all trials. Digital recruitment strategies yielded the largest number of participants across the 5 clinical trials and represented 34.0% (264/777) of the total enrolled participants. Registry-based recruitment strategies were in second place by enrolling 28.0% (217/777) of the total enrolled participants across trials. Research registry-based recruitment had a relatively high conversion rate from potential participants who contacted our center for being screened to be enrolled, and it was also the most cost-effective for enrolling participants in this set of clinical trials with a total cost per person enrolled at us $8.99. Conclusions: on the basis of these results, a framework is proposed for participant recruitment. To make decisions on initiating and maintaining different types of recruitment strategies, the resources available and requirements of the research study (or studies) need to be carefully examined.","English","eHealth; mHealth; mental health; recruitment","20",1

This program was implemented in two rural blocks in uttar pradesh state of india with an overall aim to increase quality of health care, thereby increasing utilization of maternal & child health services. The aim of the study was to assess annual & unit cost of remind program and its scale up in up state. Method and materials: economic costing was done from the health system and patient's perspectives. All resources used during designing & planning phase i.e., development of application; and implementation of the intervention, were quantified and valued. Capital costs were annualised, after assessing their average number of years for which a product could be used and accounting for its depreciation. Shared or joint costs were apportioned for the time value a resource was utilized under intervention. Annual cost of implementing remind in two blocks of up along and unit cost per pregnant woman were estimated. Scale-up cost for implementing the intervention in entire state was calculated under two scenarios - first, if no extra human resource were employed; and second, if the state government adopted the same pattern of human resource as employed under this program. Results: the annual cost for rolling out remind in two blocks of district kaushambi was inr 12.1 million (us $ 191,894). The annualised start-up cost constituted 9% of overall cost while rest of cost was attributed to implementation of the intervention. The health system program costs in remind were estimated to be inr 31.4 (us $ 0.49) per capita per year and inr 1294 (us $ 20.5) per registered women. The per capita incremental cost of scale up of intervention in up state was estimated to be inr 439 (us $ 0.07) when no additional supervisory staffs were added. Conclusion: the cost of scale up of remind in uttar pradesh is 6% of annual budget for 'reproductive and child health' line item under state budget, and hence appears to be financially sustainable.","English","mHealth; Health system cost; Costing analysis; Maternal and child and health; Community health volunteers","18",1

Methods: this prospective randomised controlled trial randomised adults with type 2 diabetes to the intervention (diabetes program) or control (usual care) arm. Key eligibility criteria included an hba1c level of at least 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) without severe or unstable comorbidities. All participants continued their usual healthcare, but participants in the intervention arm received additional diabetes care from a diabetes care coordinator via a home monitor that captured clinical measures. Data collected included biomedical, quality of life measures and healthcare (gp, outpatient and inpatient) costs. The primary outcome was hba1c collected at baseline and 6 months. Analysis was conducted on a complete case intention-to-treat basis. The healthcare system perspective was taken to calculate the incremental cost per percentage-point reduction in hba1c. Results: results from 63 participants from each study arm were analysed. Hba1c in the intervention group decreased from a median 68 mmol/mol (8.4%) to 58 mmol/mol (7.5%), and remained unchanged in the control group at median 65 mmol/mol (8.1%) at the 6-month endpoint. The intervention effect on hba1c change was statistically significant (p = .004). Total healthcare costs in the intervention group, including the intervention costs, were lower (mean $3781 vs. $4662; p < .001) compared with usual care. Discussion: there was a clinically meaningful and statistically significant benefit from the telehealth intervention at a lower cost; thus, telehealth was cost-saving and produced greater health benefits compared with usual care.","English","Type 2 diabetes; telemedicine; healthcare costs; glycaemic control; and HbA1c","24",1

Health systems are calling for greater evidence of economic impacts of particular healthcare services. Telerehabilitation programmes have the potential to reduce costs and improve patient access as an alternative to traditional care. Cost analysis has been traditionally included in study protocols and results, although the reliability and research methodology have frequently been under debate. The aim of this study was to compare costs related to a telerehabilitation programme versus conventional physiotherapy following subacromial decompression surgery (asd). Methods: the study was embedded in a randomised controlled trial. The economic analysis was based on the perspective of the health sector and the human capital method. Only the costs associated with the provision of physiotherapy services were taken into account. Costs were measured during the intervention period between baseline and 12 weeks for both groups. Student's t-test was used to compare independent variables between the two groups, with a 95% confidence interval for the estimates and real costs. Results: the estimated total cost analysis shows a preliminary cost differential in favour of the telerehabilitation group, meaning that for each participant's total intervention, telerehabilitation saves 29.8% of the costs. Real cost analysis, only for received treatments, shows a cost differential in favour of telerehabilitation, meaning that for each participant's total intervention, telerehabilitation saves 22.15% of the costs incurred for conventional rehabilitation. Conclusions: our study provides direct and meaningful information about telerehabilitation opportunities and can be an essential component in further cost evaluations for different strategies after surgical procedures. This study demonstrates that there was a trend towards lower healthcare costs after asd.

Results: the estimated added costs of the teledermatology service during 2016 amounted to 61,870 (sic). For the same period, the estimated costs of traditional outpatient dermatology services were of 113,034 (sic). This represents savings of 51,164 (sic) per year. After subtraction of societal costs, the savings equal 10,350 (sic) per year. Conclusions: using a teledermatology service instead of face-to-face dermatology consultations could save 51,164 (sic) per year (11.4 (sic) per patient visited) in the county of bages. Societal savings are the most significant.","English","Teledermatology; Telemedicine; Telehealth; Cost savings analysis; and Primary care","18",1

We developed a smartphone octo-channel spectrometer (sos) as a mhealth diagnostic tool. The sos has nanoscale wavelength resolution, is self-illuminated from the smartphone itself, and is ultra-low cost (less than $20). A user interface controls the optical sensing parameters and precise alignment. After calibrating and testing the sos by quantifying protein concentrations, we clinically validated the sos by comparing the diagnostic performance of our device with that of a clinical spectrophotometer. About 180 serum samples from de-identified patients with 4 types of autoantibodies were blindly read the elisa results. The accuracy of the sos achieved 100% across the clinical reportable range compared with the fda-approved instrument. Furthermore, the self-illuminated sos only requires about half of the light intensity of the fda-approved instrument to achieve clinical-level sensitivity. The low-energy-consumption and low-cost sos enables point-of-care spectrophotometric sensing in low-resource areas, and can be integrated into point-of-care diagnostic systems for rapid multiplex readout and analysis at patient bedside or at home.","English","autoantibody tests; mobile health; multichannel spectrometer; smartphone and optosensor","11",1

Bangladesh has one of the largest numbers of adults with diabetes in the south asian region. This paper describes the planned economic evaluation of a three-arm cluster randomised control trial of mhealth and community mobilisation interventions to prevent and control t2dm and non-communicable diseases' risk factors in rural bangladesh (d-magic trial). Methods and analysis the economic evaluation will be conducted as a within-trial analysis to evaluate the incremental costs and health outcomes of mhealth and community mobilisation interventions compared with the status quo. The analyses will be conducted from a societal perspective, assessing the economic impact for all parties affected by the interventions, including implementing agencies (programme costs), healthcare providers, and participants and their households. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (icers) will be calculated in terms of cost per case of intermediate hyperglycaemia and t2dm prevented and cost per case of diabetes prevented among individuals with intermediate hyperglycaemia at baseline and cost per mm hg reduction in systolic blood pressure. In addition to icers, the economic evaluation will be presented as a cost-consequence analysis where the incremental costs and all statistically significant outcomes will be listed separately. Robustness of the results will be assessed through sensitivity analyses. In addition, an analysis of equity impact of the interventions will be conducted.

Less clear is the cost effectiveness of fh screening when it includes case identification strategies that incorporate routinely available data from primary and secondary care electronic health records. Methods: nine strategies were compared, all using cascade testing in combination with different index case approaches (primary care identification, secondary care identification, and clinical assessment using the simon broome (sb) or dutch lipid clinic network (dlcn) criteria). A decision analytic model was informed by three systematic literature reviews and expert advice provided by a nice guideline committee. Results: the model found that the addition of primary care case identification by database search for patients with recorded total cholesterol >9.3 mmol/l was more cost effective than cascade testing alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (icer) of clinical assessment using the dlcn criteria was (sic)3254 per quality-adjusted life year (qaly) compared with case-finding with no genetic testing. The icer of clinical assessment using the sb criteria was (sic)13,365 per qaly (compared with primary care identification using the dlcn criteria), indicating that the sb criteria was preferred because it achieved additional health benefits at an acceptable cost.

Telestroke networks have expanded the reach of stroke experts to underserved, geographically remote areas. This study illustrates the outcome and cost differences between neurology and primary care ischemic stroke admissions to demonstrate a need for telestroke networks within the military health system (mhs). Materials and methods: all adult admissions with a primary diagnosis of ischemic stroke in the mhs military mart database from calendar years 2010 to 2015 were reviewed. Neurology, primary care, and intensive care unit (icu) admissions were compared across primary outcomes of (1) disposition status and (2) intravenous tissue plasminogen activator administration and for secondary outcomes of (1) total cost of hospitalization and (2) length of stay (los). Results: a total of 3623 admissions met the study's parameters. The composition was neurology 462 (12.8%), primary care 2324 (64.1%), icu 677 (18.7%), and other/ unknown 160 (4.4%). Almost all neurology admissions (97%) were at the 3 neurology training programs, whereas a strong majority of primary care admissions (80%) were at hospitals without a neurology admitting service. Hospitals without a neurology admitting service had more discharges to rehabilitation facilities and higher rates of in-hospital mortality. Los was also longer in primary care admissions. Conclusions: ischemic stroke admissions to neurology had better outcomes and decreased los when compared to primary care within the mhs. This demonstrates a possible gap in care.

Objective: this study sought to model the incremental cost-effectiveness of gradually scaling up text messaging services to pregnant women throughout gauteng province, south africa from 2012 to 2017. Methods: data collection occurred as part of a retrospective study in 6 health centers in gauteng province. Stage-based short message service (sms) text messages on maternal health were sent to pregnant women twice per week during pregnancy and continued until the infant's first birthday. Program costs, incremental costs to users, and the health system costs for these women were measured along with changes in the utilization of antenatal care visits and childhood immunizations and compared with those from a control group of pregnant women who received no sms text messages. Incremental changes in utilization were entered into the lives saved tool and used to forecast lives saved and disability adjusted life years (dalys) averted by scaling up program activities over 5 years to reach 60% of pregnant women across gauteng province. Uncertainty was characterized using one-way and probabilistic uncertainty analyses. Results: five-year program costs were estimated to be us $1 2 million, 17% of which were incurred by costs on program development and 31% on sms text message delivery costs. Costs to users were us $1.66 to attend clinic-based services, nearly 90% of which was attributed to wages lost. Costs to the health system included provider time costs to register users (us $0.08) and to provide antenatal care (us $4.36) and postnatal care (us $3.08) services. Incremental costs per daly averted from a societal perspective ranged from us $1985 in the first year of implementation to us $200 in the 5th year. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of us $2000, the project had a 40% probability of being cost-effective in year 1 versus 100% in all years thereafter. Conclusions: study findings suggest that delivering sms text messages on maternal health information to pregnant and postpartum women may be a cost-effective strategy for bolstering antenatal care and childhood immunizations, even at very small margins of coverage increases.

Even where cart is available free of charge, social determinants of health act as barriers to optimal adherence rates. Patient-centered approaches exploiting mobile phone communications (mhealth) have been shown to improve adherence to cart and promote achievement of suppressed hiv plasma viral loads. However, data are scarce on the health care provider (hcp) time commitments and health care costs associated with such interventions. This knowledge is needed to inform policy and programmatic implementation. Objective: the purpose of this study was to approximate the resources required and to provide an estimate of the costs associated with running an mhealth intervention program to improve medication adherence in people living with hiv (plwh). Methods: this prospective study of hcp utilization and costs was embedded within a repeated measures effectiveness study of the weltel short-message service (sms) mhealth program. The study included 85 vulnerable, nonadherent plwh in vancouver, canada, and resulted in improved medication adherence and hiv plasma viral load among participants. Study participants were provided mobile phones with unlimited texting (where required) and received weekly bidirectional text messages to inquire on their status for one year. A clinic nurse triaged and managed participants' responses, immediately logging all patient interactions by topic, hcp involvement, and time dedicated to addressing issues raised by participants. Interaction costs were determined in canadian dollars based on hcp type, median salary within our health authority, and their time utilized as part of the intervention. Results: participant-identified problems within text responses included health-related, social, and logistical issues. Taken together, management of problems required a median of 43 minutes (interquartile range, iqr 17-99) of hcp time per participant per year, for a median yearly cost of can $36.72 (iqr 15.50-81.60) per participant who responded with at least one problem. The clinic nurse who monitored the texts solved or managed 65% of these issues, and the remaining were referred to a variety of other hcps. The total intervention costs, including mobile phones, plans, and staffing were a median can $347.74/highly vulnerable participant per year for all participants or can $383.18/highly vulnerable participant per year for those who responded with at least one problem.

Design: retrospective observational. Setting: large healthcare system in florida. Patients: adult patients admitted to progressive care unit (pcu) as their primary admission between december 2011 and august 2016 (n = 16,091). Interventions: progressive care unit patients with telemedicine intervention (telemedicine pcu [tpcu]; n = 8091) and without telemedicine control (nontelemedicine pcu [ntpcu]; n = 8000) were compared concurrently during study period. Measurements and main results: primary outcome was progressive care unit and hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay, progressive care unit length of stay, and mean direct costs. The mean age ntpcu and tpcu patients were 63.4 years (95% ci, 62.9-63.8 yr) and 71.1 years (95% ci, 70.7-71.4 yr), respectively. All patient refined-diagnosis related group disease severity (p < 0.0001) and all patient refined-diagnosis related group patient risk of mortality (p < 0.0001) scores were significantly higher among tpcu versus ntpcu. After adjusting for age, sex, race, disease severity, risk of mortality, hospital entity, and organ systems, tpcu survival benefit was 20%. Mean progressive care unit length of stay was lower among tpcu compared with ntpcu (2.6 vs 3.2 d; p < 0.0001). Postprogressive care unit hospital length of stay was longer for tpcu patients, compared with ntpcu (7.3 vs 6.8 d; p < 0.0001).

Conclusions: although there are many studies about the effects of telemedicine in icu, currently there are no studies on the effects of telemedicine in progressive care unit settings. Our study showed that tpcu intervention significantly decreased mortality in progressive care unit and hospital and progressive care unit length of stay despite the fact patients in tpcu were older and had higher disease severity, and risk of mortality. Increased postprogressive care unit hospital length of stay and total mean direct costs inclusive of telemedicine costs coincided with improved survival rates.

In this study, the authors evaluate the cost-effectiveness of tm consultations for followup care of a large population of patients who underwent neurosurgical procedures. Methods a decision-analytical model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of tm for elective post-neurosurgical care patients from a predominantly nonurban cohort in west bengal, india. The model compared tm care via a nodal center in west bengal to routine, in-person, per-episode care at the provider site in bangalore, india. Cost and effectiveness data relating to 1200 patients were collected for a 52-month period. The effectiveness of tm care was calculated using efficiency in terms of the percentage of successful tm consultations, as well as patient-perceived utility values for overall experience of the type of health care access that they received. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (icer) analysis was done using the 4-quadrant charting of the cost-effectiveness plane. One-way sensitivity and tornado analyses were performed to identify thresholds where the care strategy would change. Results the overall utility for the 3 tm scenarios was found to be higher (89%) than for the utility of routine care (80%). Tm was found to be more cost-effective (indian rupee [inr] 2630 per patient) compared to routine care (inr 6848 per patient). The tm strategy ""dominates"" that of routine care by being more effective and less expensive (icer value of -39,400 inr/unit of effectiveness). Sensitivity analysis revealed that cost-effectiveness of tm was most sensitive to changes in the number of tm patients, utility and success rate of tm, and travel distance to the tm center. Conclusions tm care dominates the in-person care strategy by providing more effective and less expensive followup care for a remote post-neurosurgical care population in india. In the authors' setting, this benefit of tm is sustainable even if half the tm consultations turn out to be unsuccessful. The viability of tm as a cost-effective care protocol is attributed to a combination of factors, like an adequate patient volume utilizing tm, patient utility, success rate of tm, and the patient travel distance.","English","cost-effectiveness; telemedicine; postoperative; follow-up; neurosurgery","44",1

Results: ninety-three percent and 84.7% of the study and baseline cohorts, respectively, had $0.00 in target costs (p = .004), with a mean savings of $656.52/patient (p = .006). The baseline and study cohorts had 3.0% and 1.6% 90-day hospital admission rates (relative risk 0.545; 0.154, 1.931, p = .40), and 15.3% and 7.0% composite complication rates, respectively (relative risk 0.456; 0.256, 0.812, p = .004). Conclusion: patients enrolled on an automated dpe platform after hip and knee arthroplasties demonstrated a significant reduction in potentially avoidable 90-day costs, a 45.4% nonsignificant relative reduction in 90-day hospital admissions, and a 54.4% significant relative reduction in 90-day complications.

Design: retrospective chart review. Participants: infants from an existing telemedicine screening program at 2 cities in ontario, canada. Methods: we conducted a cost analysis comparison from the perspective of the ministry of health. Patient level data was used for the telemedicine group. A hypothetical control group consisted of the minimum number of bio and interhospital transfers if the existing patients were screened in person. Costs included in-person examinations, transfers, setting up, and ongoing costs of telemedicine screening. Costs were compared using the mann-whitney u test and are reported in 2014 canadian dollars. Results: a total of 102 and 72 infants were screened from sudbury and barrie, respectively; 3% and 2% of infants in the telemedicine group were transferred for bio from sudbury and barrie, respectively. All infants in the control group would have required at least one transfer for bio. The average total cost per eye examination was $4855 +/- $5616 and $4540 +/- $3129 for the telemedicine group and $19 834 +/- $13 814 and $2429 +/- $1664 for the control group from sudbury and barrie, respectively (p < 0.001). Interhospital transfer cost for the control group was $19 489 +/- $13 605 and $2055 +/- $1471 compared to $635 +/- $3968 and $30 +/- $197 for the telemedicine group (p < 0.001) in sudbury and barrie, respectively.

Introduction: despite enthusiasm from the global health community, lmics have not demonstrated high uptake of m-health promoting policies or public investment. Materials and methods: to benchmark the current status, this study compared m-health policy readiness scores between sub-saharan africa and high-income organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) countries using an independent two-sample t test. In addition, the enabling factors associated with m-health policy readiness were investigated using an ordinal logistic regression model. The study was based on the m-health policy readiness scores of 112 countries obtained from the world health organization third global survey on e-health. Results: the mean m-health policy readiness score for sub-saharan africa was statistically significantly lower than that for oecd countries (p = 0.02). The enabling factors significantly associated with m-health policy readiness included information and communication technology development index (odds ratio [or] 1.57; 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.12-2.2), e-health education for health professionals (or 4.43; 95% ci 1.60-12.27), and the location in sub-saharan africa (or 3.47; 95% ci 1.06-11.34). Discussion: the findings of our study suggest dual policy goals for m-health in sub-saharan africa. First, enhance technological and educational support for m-health. Second, pursue global collaboration for building m-health capacity led by sub-saharan african countries with hands-on experience and knowledge. Conclusion: globally, countries should take a systematic and collaborative approach in pursuing m-health policy with the focus on technological and educational support.","English","m-health; policy; sub-Saharan Africa; WHO Global Survey on e-Health; and telemedicine","24",1

The study compared program outcomes with those of usual care involving ambulance transport to the hospital for in-person psychiatric emergency consultation prior to disposition to inpatient care or discharge home. Methods: this study compared process outcomes in a cross-sectional, pre-post design at five network-of-care sites before and after systemwide implementation of telepsychiatry consultation in 2015. Clinical records on 494 pediatric psychiatric emergencies included ed length of stay, disposition/discharge, and hospital system charges. Satisfaction surveys regarding telepsychiatry consultations were completed by providers and parents or guardians. Results: compared with children who received usual care, children who received telepsychiatry consultations had significantly shorter median ed lengths of stay (5.5 hours and 8.3 hours, respectively, p<.001) and lower total patient charges ($3,493 and $8,611, p<.001). Providers and patient caregivers reported high satisfaction with overall acceptability, effectiveness, and efficiency of telepsychiatry. No safety concerns were indicated based on readmissions within 72 hours in either treatment condition. Conclusions: measured by charges and time, telepsychiatry consultations for pediatric psychiatric emergencies were cost-efficient from a hospital system perspective compared with usual care consisting of ambulance transport for in-person consultation at a children's hospital main campus. Telepsychiatry also improved clinical and operational efficiency and patient and family experience, and it showed promise for increasing access to other specialized health care needs.","English",NA,"69",1

Methodsusing national guidelines, a framework was developed outlining dietitian-delivered weight management for in-person and ehealth delivery modes. This framework mapped one-on-one patient-dietitian consultations for an adult requiring active management (bmi 30 kg/m(2)) over a one-year period using both delivery modes. Resources required for both the dietitian and patient to implement each treatment mode were identified, with costs attributed for material, fixed, travel and personnel components. The resource costs were categorised as either establishment or recurring costs associated with the treatment of one patient. Resultsestablishment costs were higher for ehealth compared to in-person costs ($1394.21 vs $90.05). Excluding establishment costs, the total (combined dietitian and patient) cost for one patient receiving best-practice weight management for 12 months was $560.59 for in-person delivery, compared to $389.78 for ehealth delivery. Compared to the ehealth mode, a higher proportion of the overall recurring delivery costs was attributed to the patient for the in-person mode (46.4% and 33.9%, respectively). Conclusionsalthough it is initially more expensive to establish an ehealth service mode, the overall reoccurring costs per patient for delivery of best-practice weight management were lower compared to the in-person mode. This theoretical cost evaluation establishes preliminary evidence to support alternative obesity management service models using ehealth technologies. Further research is required to determine the feasibility, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these models within dietetic practice.","English","cost evaluation; dietetics; eHealth; obesity; telehealth","75",1

This study assesses the actual cost-effectiveness of initiating and implementing the use of the mhealth as a supply side job aid for antenatal care. The study also estimates the cost-effectiveness ratio if mhealth was also used to encourage and track women through facility delivery. Methods: the methodology utilized a retrospective, micro-costing technique to extract costing data from health facilities and administrative offices to estimate the costs of implementing the mhealth antenatal care program and estimate the cost of facility delivery for those that used the antenatal care services in the year 2014. Five different costing tools were developed to assist in the costing analysis. Findings: the results show that the provision of tetanus toxoid vaccination and malaria prophylaxis during pregnancy and improved labor and delivery during facility delivery contributed the most to mortality reductions for women, neonates and stillbirths in mhealth facilities versus non-mhealth facilities. The cost-effectiveness ratio of this program for antenatal care and no demand-side generation for facility delivery is us$13,739 per life saved. The cost-effectiveness ratio adding in an additional demand-side generation for facility births reduces to us$9,806 per life saved.

Filtering methods like moving average window (maw), principal component analysis (pca) and a simplified kalman filter have already been used for smoothing and for sensor precision improvement. The comparison of these methods with sg filtering shows that the latter can offer a significant precision improvement without the problems offered by other methods like the latency of the maw. More specifically, the sg filtering can offer an up to 10 times better normalized mean square error (nmse) or 25db higher signal to noise ratio (snr) than the original values.

Cost is a more elusive concept than is commonly thought and can be particularly elusive in multidisciplinary territory like hta.results:the article explains that cost is more completely defined as opportunity cost, why cost is necessarily associated with a decision, and that it will always vary according to the context of that decision: whether choice is about inputs or outputs, what the alternatives are, the timing of the consequences of the decision, the nature of the commitment to which a decision maker is committed, who the decision maker is, and the constraints and discretion limiting or liberating the decision maker. Distinctions between short and long runs and between fixed and variable inputs are matters of choice, not technology, and are similarly context-dependent. Harms or negative consequences are, in general, not costs. Whether so-called clinically unrelated future costs and benefits should be counted in current decisions again depends on context.conclusions:the costs of entire health programs are context-dependent, relating to planned rates of activity, volumes, and timings.

Current uptake rates however, remain low. This study assesses the social and economic impact of increasing centre-based cardiac rehabilitation uptake and the additional value of cardiac telerehabilitation using cost-benefit analysis (cba) in belgium. Methods: cost-benefit analysis was conducted to analyse three scenarios: (1) current situation: 20% uptake rate of cardiac rehabilitation; (2) alternative scenario one: 40% uptake rate of cardiac rehabilitation; and (3) alternative scenario two: 20% uptake of cardiac rehabilitation and 20% uptake of both cardiac rehabilitation and telerehabilitation. Impacts considered included cardiac (tele)rehabilitation programme costs, direct inpatient costs, productivity losses and burden of disease. Results: compared to the current situation, there was a net total monetised benefit of 9.18 meuro and 9.10 meuro for scenarios one and two, respectively. Disability adjusted life years were 12,805-12,980 years lower than the current situation. This resulted in a benefit-cost ratio of 1.52 and 1.43 for scenarios one and two, respectively. Conclusions: increased cardiac rehabilitation uptake rates can reduce the burden of disease, and the resulting benefits exceed its costs. This research supports the necessity for greater promotion and routine referral to cardiac rehabilitation to be made standard practice.

Access is a two-way audio-visual program linking remote emergency department physicians and their patients to stroke specialists. Access also has an education component in which hospitals receive training from stroke specialists on the triage and treatment of patients. This study assessed the clinical and economic outcomes of the access program in providing services to rural new mexico from a healthcare payer perspective.methods: a decision tree model was constructed using findings from the access program and existing literature, the likelihood that a patient will receive a tissue plasminogen activator (tpa), cost of care, and resulting quality adjusted life years (qalys). Data from the access program includes emergency room patients in rural new mexico from may 2015 to august 2016. Outcomes and costs have been estimated for patients who were taken to a hospital providing neurological telecare and patients who were not.results: the use of access decreased neuro-emergent stroke patient transfers from rural hospitals to urban settings from 85% to 5% (no tpa) and 90% to 23% (tpa), while stroke specialist reading of patient ct/mri imaging within 3h of onset of stroke symptoms increased from 2% to 22%. Results indicate that use of access has the potential to save $4,241 ($3,952-$4,438) per patient and increase qalys by 0.20 (0.14-0.22). This increase in qalys equates to approximate to 73 more days of life at full health. The cost savings and qalys are expected to increase when moving from a 90-day model to a lifetime model.conclusion: the analysis demonstrates potential savings and improved quality-of-life associated with the use of access for patients presenting to rural hospitals with acute ischemic stroke (ais).","English","Cost effectiveness; stroke; stroke care; telemedicine; patient and transport; tPA; rural healthcare","21",1

Our previous economic evaluation demonstrated tele-icu to be cost-effective in most cases and cost saving in some cases, compared to conventional intensive care unit (icu) care without adequate intensivist coverage.introduction:this study's objective is to examine how to optimize the cost-effectiveness of tele-icu use by selecting highest risk (i.e., both highest mortality and highest cost) subpopulations. We also explore potential cost savings.materials and methods:we conducted simulation analyses among a hypothetical adult icu patient cohort defined by the literature, distinguishing four types of hospitals: urban tertiary (primary analysis), urban community, rural tertiary, and rural community. The selected tele-icu use was assumed to affect per-patient icu cost and hospital mortality among highest risk subpopulations (10-100% of all icu patients), defined by an established illness-severity measure.results:we found a u-shaped relationship between the economic efficiency and selected tele-icu use among all 4 hospital types. Optimal cost-effectiveness was achieved when tele-icu was applied to the 30-40% highest risk patients among all icu patients (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio=$25,392 [2014 u.s. dollars] per extending a quality-adjusted life year) in urban tertiary hospitals (primary analysis). Our break-even analyses indicated that cost saving seems more feasible when reducing icu medical care cost, rather than lowering the cost to operate telemedicine alone.discussion and conclusions:a selected use of tele-icu based on severity of illness is likely to improve tele-icu cost-effectiveness. To achieve cost saving, tele-icu must reduce more than just telemedicine-related cost.","English","telemedicine; telehealth; intensive care units; economic evaluation; and cost-effectiveness; cost saving","24",1

Second, we study using modeling and simulations, the problem of cost-effective medical advisory message dissemination (on the downlink) which gives rise to an interesting cost-delay trade-off when leveraging free short range phone-to-phone (p2p) communication. Finally, we build a proof-of-concept testbed, coined cellchek, which showcases the proposed wisa algorithm and demonstrates its operation using sample wireless-enabled medical devices, namely pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitor. The experimental results gathered using the prototype provide key insights into the system and the involved tradeoffs. The concepts explored in this paper along with the proposed schemes hold great promise for this emerging area of research that is of equal importance to developing and developed countries promising considerable cost savings.","English","Data dissemination; delay; experimental results; interface selection; and mobile health care; simulation; testbed","11",1

Objective: to examine the potential of mobile electronic devices compared with paper-based tools in health data collection. Methods: using data from 961 households from the rufiji household and demographic survey in tanzania, the quality and costs of data collected on paper forms and electronic devices were compared. We also documented, using qualitative approaches, field workers, whom we called 'enumerators', and households' members on the use of both methods. Existing administrative records were combined with logistics expenditure measured directly from comparison households to approximate annual costs per 1,000 households surveyed. Results: errors were detected in 17% (166) of households for the paper records and 2% (15) for the electronic records (p < 0.001). There were differences in the types of errors (p = 0.03). Of the errors occurring, a higher proportion were due to accuracy in paper surveys (79%, 95% ci: 72%, 86%) compared with electronic surveys (58%, 95% ci: 29%, 87%). Errors in electronic surveys were more likely to be related to completeness (32%, 95% ci 12%, 56%) than in paper surveys (11%, 95% ci: 7%, 17%). The median duration of the interviews ('enumeration'), per household was 9.4 minutes (90% central range 6.4, 12.2) for paper and 8.3 (6.1, 12.0) for electronic surveys (p = 0.001). Surveys using electronic tools, compared with paper-based tools, were less costly by 28% for recurrent and 19% for total costs. Although there were technical problems with electronic devices, there was good acceptance of both methods by enumerators and members of the community.

However, admission centers (spokes) are subject to financial charges which can make them reluctant to join the system. We implemented and assessed an economic model supporting our telestroke system, virtuall, france, which includes one expert center (hub) and six spokes. Methods: the model is based on payment for the expertise provided by the hub, distribution of charges related to telemedicine according to the fees perceived by the spokes, and transfer of patients between the spokes and the hub. We performed a cost-benefit analysis for all patients included in virtuall from january 2014 to december 2015 to assess the economic balance in each center. Results: 321 patients were prospectively included in the study. Application of the economic model resulted in overall financial balance with funding of a dedicated medical service in the hub, and reduced costs directly related to telestroke by an average of 10% in the spokes. The conditions generating the highest costs for the spokes were: a patient returning from the hub for re-hospitalization (mean cost of $1,995/patient); management of patients treated by intravenous thrombolysis without transfer to the hub (mean cost of $2,075/patient). The most favorable financial condition for the spokes remained simple transfer of patients to the hub and no return (mean cost of $329/patient).

In-ambulance telemedicine, defined by live bidirectional audio-video between a patient and a neurologist in a moving ambulance and the automated transfer of vital parameters, is a promising new approach to speed up and improve the quality of acute stroke care. Currently, no evidence exists on the cost effectiveness of in-ambulance telemedicine. Objective: we aim to develop a first cost effectiveness model for in-ambulance telemedicine and use this model to estimate the time savings needed before in-ambulance telemedicine becomes cost effective. Methods: current standard stroke care is compared with current standard stroke care supplemented with in-ambulance telemedicine using a cost-utility model measuring costs and quality-adjusted life-years (qalys) from a health care perspective. We combine a decision tree with a markov model. Data from the uz brussel stroke registry (2282 stroke patients) and linked hospital claims data at individual level are combined with literature data to populate the model. A 2-way sensitivity analysis varying both implementation costs and time gain is performed to map the different cost-effective combinations and identify the time gain needed for cost effectiveness and dominance. For several modeled time gains, the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve is calculated and mapped in 1 figure. Results: under the base-case scenario (implementation cost of us $ 159,425) and taking a lifetime horizon into account, in-ambulance telemedicine is a cost-effective strategy compared to standard stroke care alone starting from a time gain of 6 minutes. After 12 minutes, in-ambulance telemedicine becomes dominant, and this results in a mean decrease of costs by us -$ 30 (95% ci -$ 32 to -$ 29) per patient with 0.00456 (95% ci 0.00448 to 0.00463) qalys on average gained per patient. In over 82% of all probabilistic simulations, in-ambulance telemedicine remains under the cost-effectiveness threshold of us $ 47,747. Conclusions: our model suggests that in-ambulance telemedicine can be cost effective starting from a time gain of 6 minutes and becomes a dominant strategy after approximately 15 minutes. This indicates that in-ambulance telemedicine has the potential to become a cost-effective intervention assuming time gains in clinical implementations are realized in the future.","English","telemedicine; prehospital; stroke; cost effectiveness","5",1

Methods: the telemedicine outreach for ptsd (top) study used a pragmatic randomized effectiveness trial to examine effects of ptsd care teams located at veterans affairs medical centers and supporting primary care providers in satellite clinics. Teams included a nurse care manager, pharmacist, psychologist, and psychiatrist. Effectiveness was estimated with quality-adjusted life years (qalys) derived from the short form health survey for veterans and quality of well-being (qwb) scale. Intervention and health care costs were collected to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Results: the sample (n=265) included mostly rural, unemployed, middle-aged men with a military service-connected disability for ptsd randomly assigned to top or usual care. Only minor improvements in qwb qalys were found. The top intervention was relatively expensive, with costs totaling $2,029 per patient per year. Intervention costs were not offset by reductions in health care utilization costs, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $185,565 per qaly (interquartile range $57,675 to $395,743). Conclusions: because of the upfront training costs and the resource-intensive nature of this intervention, associated expenses were high. Although ptsd-specific effectiveness measures were significantly improved, these changes did not translate to qalys in the main analysis. However, analyses focusing on patient subgroups with comorbid mental disorders indicated greater qaly improvement for top at lower cost.","English",NA,"68",1

Modeling can estimate costs and outcomes for patients with cieds under a variety of scenarios, varying battery longevity, comorbidities, and care settings. The objective of this analysis was to compare changes in patient outcomes and payer costs attributable to increases in battery life of implantable cardiac defibrillators (icds) and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators (crt-d). We developed a monte carlo markov model simulation to follow patients through primary implant, postoperative maintenance, generator replacement, and revision states. Patients were simulated in 3-month increments for 15 years or until death. Key variables included charlson comorbidity index, cied type, legacy versus extended battery longevity, mortality rates (procedure and all-cause), infection and non-infectious complication rates, and care settings. Costs included procedure-related (facility and professional), maintenance, and infections and non-infectious complications, all derived from medicare data (2004-2014, 5% sample). Outcomes included counts of battery replacements, revisions, infections and non-infectious complications, and discounted (3%) costs and life years. An increase in battery longevity in icds yielded reductions in numbers of revisions (by 23%), battery changes (by 44%), infections (by 23%), non-infectious complications (by 10%), and total costs per patient (by 9%). Analogous reductions for crt-ds were 23% (revisions), 32% (battery changes), 22% (infections), 8% (complications), and 10% (costs). Based on modeling results, as battery longevity increases, patients experience fewer adverse outcomes and healthcare costs are reduced. Understanding the magnitude of the cost benefit of extended battery life can inform budgeting and planning decisions by healthcare providers and insurers.","English","Battery life; Cardiac resynchronization therapy devices; Costs and cost and analysis; Device battery replacement; Device longevity","50",1

The aim of this telerehab iii follow-up study was to assess whether a 6-month additional cardiac telerehabilitation programme could induce long-term health benefits and remain cost-efficient after the tele-intervention ended. Methods and results: a total of 126 cardiac patients first completed the multicentre, randomised controlled telerehabilitation trial (telerehab iii, time points t(0) to t(1)). They consequently entered the follow-up study (t(1)) with evaluations 2 years later (t(2)). A quantitative analysis of peak aerobic capacity (vo2 peak, primary endpoint), international physical activity questionnaire self-reported physical activity and heartqol quality of life (secondary endpoints) was performed. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated. Even though a decline in vo2 peak (248ml/[min*kg] at t(1) and 226ml/[min*kg] at t(2); p <= 0.001) was observed within the tele-intervention group patients; overall they did better than the no tele-intervention group (p=0.032).

This study has used practical telecommunication standards, which is widely deployed throughout india. Methods: in the proposed scenario, patient's eye images are obtained using a specified imaging modality, and then sent to a server at the primary eye care centre (pecc) using zigbee a short-range wireless network. It is linked to the main server at the base eye hospital (beh) through a gsm/umts (3g)/wimax (worldwide interoperability for microwave access) network. After diagnostic evaluation of the eye image using various automated diagnostic software, data are sent to a physician in an urban center for further validation, which is connected through gsm/umts (3g)/wimax network. Performance evaluation of these wireless networks is carried out for their use in teleophthalmology application based on network parameters, namely throughput, average end-to-end delay, and average jitter. It is found that end-to-end delay is the most critical network parameter affecting overall quality of service (qos) of the proposed teleophthalmology network. Results and conclusions: the results demonstrate that wimax is the most suitable network among the considered networks for connecting pecc nodes with beh main server, and further connecting main server with a doctor on the move. It is also deduced that for a given set of qos parameters, wimax supports a load capacity of 22,000 packets at center nodes and the main server and it performs well even when the mobility speed of doctor exceeds 200 kph.","English","teleophthalmology; telemedicine; Kumbh Mela; ZigBee; GSM; UMTS (3G); and WiMAX","23",1

Methods: the ktx360 degrees study is supported by a grant from the federal joint committee of the federal republic of germany. The study will include 448 (39 children) incident patients of all ages with ktx after study start in may 2017 and 963 (83 children) prevalent patients with ktx between 2010 and 2016. The collaboration between transplant centers and nephrologists in private local practices will be supported by internet-based case-files and scheduled virtual visits (patient consultation via video conferencing). At specified points of the care process patients will receive cardiovascular and adherence assessments and respective interventions. Care will be coordinated by an additional case management. The goals of the study will be evaluated by an independent institute using claims data from the statutory health insurances and data collected from patients and their caregivers during study participation. To model longitudinal changes after transplantation and differences in changes and levels of immunosuppresive therapy after transplantation between study participants and historical data as well as data from control patients who do not participate in ktx360 degrees, adjusted regression analyses, such as mixed models with repeated measures, will be used. Relevant confounders will be controlled in all analyses.

The main outcome measure was proportion of cts ordered by provider (total number of ct scans of a given type divided by total patients seen by that provider) in aggregate in the pre- and post intervention period. Results: there were 235,858 total patient visits analyzed in this study with an absolute decrease of 6,106 ct scan ordering for the three studies. Across all sites, there was greater than 6% decrease in utilization of ct brain and ct c-spine (-10%, 95% ci = -13% to -7%, p < 0.001; and -6%, 95% ci = -11% to -1%, p = 0.03, respectively). The use of ct pe also decreased but was not significant (-2%, 95% ci = -9% to +5%, p = 0.42). For all ct types, high utilizers in the pre-intervention period decreased usage over 14% in the post-intervention period with ct brain (-18%, 95% ci = -22% to -15%, p < 0.001), ct c-spine (-14%, 95% ci = -20% to -8%, p = 0.001), and ct pe (-23%, 95% ci = -31% to -14%, p < 0.001). For all three studies, the average utilizers did not change their usage practices. For ct brain, the low utilizers also did not increase usage but for ct c-spine and ct pe usage was increased (+ 29%, 95% ci = 10% to 52%, p = 0.003; and +46%, 95% ci = 26% to 70%, p < 0.001, respectively). Conclusion: embedded clinical decision support is associated with decreased overall utilization of high-cost imaging, especially among higher utilizers. It also affected low utilizers, increasing their usage consistent with improved adherence to guidelines, but this effect did not offset the overall decreased utilization for ct brain or ct c-spine. Thus, integrating clinical decision support into the provider workflow promotes usage of validated tools across providers, which can standardize the delivery of care and improve compliance with evidence-based guidelines.","English",NA,"24",1

Therefore, it is essential that they have access to optimal supportive care services. The ehealth self-management application oncokompas was developed to support cancer survivors with where they need to turn to for advice and guidance, as well as to increase their knowledge on the availability of optimal support. A randomised controlled trial will be conducted to assess the efficacy, cost-utility and reach of oncokompas as an ehealth self-management application compared with care as usual among cancer survivors. Methods/design: adult cancer survivors diagnosed with breast, colorectal or head and neck cancer or lymphoma who are at 3 months to 5 years since curative treatment will be included. In total, 544 cancer survivors will be randomly assigned to the intervention group or a wait-list control group. The primary outcome measure is patient activation. Secondary outcome measures include self-efficacy, personal control, perceived patient-physician interaction, need for supportive care, mental adjustment to cancer and health-related quality of life. Furthermore, cost-utility outcomes will be assessed. Reach is defined as the percentage of cancer survivors who get access to oncokompas within the context of this trial. Questionnaires will be administered at baseline, post-intervention and at 3-and 6-month follow-up. Discussion: in this study, we will evaluate the efficacy and cost-utility of oncokompas among cancer survivors, as well as the reach of oncokompas. These are essential first steps in the translation of research into practice and contribute to sustainable adoption, implementation and maintenance of an evidence-based oncokompas.","English","Cancer survivors; eHealth application; Self-management; Patient and activation; Supportive care","18",1

The purpose of this study was to describe the access to low-cost consumer technologies and willingness to use them to receive rehabilitation services among stroke survivors.materials and methods:participants were included in this survey study if they had a stroke, lived in the community, were 19 years of age or older, and able to understand english. Participants completed a study-specific telerehabilitation survey via phone call, mail, in-person, or online. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample and survey responses.results:one hundred two survey responses were returned, representing a 79.1% response rate. The mean age of this urban (67.3%) and rural (32.7%) sample was 67.6 years. The technologies most commonly owned were as follows: televisions (91%), landline telephones (88.0%), and computers (79.0%). A large proportion of the sample reported an interest to receive assessments (58.4%), training and exercise programs (64.0%), and education (61.4%) via telerehabilitation, however, many were not interested to receive telerehabilitation (approximate to 39%) and believed that the quality of care would be less than in-person rehabilitation (71.0%).Conclusions:the use of consumer technologies for the delivery of rehabilitation services is both feasible and desirable by stroke survivors. Telerehabilitation services at present should augment and not replace in-person rehabilitation. However, in cases where in-person rehabilitation is neither accessible nor possible, telerehabilitation could serve as an acceptable alternative and is a key area for future research.","English","telerehabilitation; stroke; telehealth; technology","23",1

The purpose of this study was to determine whether digital breast tomosynthesis (dbt) is a cost-effective alternative to full-field digital mammography (ffdm) for both medicare and privately insured patients undergoing screening mammography. Materials and methods. A retrospective data analysis was performed between july 15, 2013, and july 14, 2014, with data on women presenting for screening mammography that included any additional radiologic workup (n = 6319). Patients chose to undergo dbt or ffdm on the basis of personal preference, physician suggestion, and cost difference. The summation of findings over the 1-year period were used to calculate recall rates, cancer detection rates, and billing costs for a regional private insurer and medicare. Results. Data from the 6319 patients who participated were divided: 3655 patients underwent dbt, and 2664 underwent ffdm during the year of screening. Private insurance billing cost $2.9 million, and medicare cost $1.2 million for screening, follow-up imaging, and radiologic procedures. Per-person costs were approximately $40 higher for the dbt group using both forms of insurance. However, cost per cancer detected was lower in the dbt group for both private and governmental insurance, leading to potentially $3.7 million and $899,000 saved per 100 cancers found. After standardization of the difference in cancer detection rates between the two groups, dbt was a cost-equivalent alternative to ffdm for private insurance billing but was a cost-inefficient alternative with respect to medicare costs. Conclusion. In a community-based setting, dbt is a cost-equivalent or potentially cost-effective alternative to ffdm and has the capacity for improving cancer detection and recall rates.","English","breast cancer; cost-effectiveness; digital breast tomosynthesis; and screening mammography","208",1

Model-based health economic evaluations of tests allow different types of evidence from various sources to be incorporated and enable cost-effectiveness estimates to be made beyond the duration of available study data. To parameterize a health-economic model fully, all the ways a test impacts on patient health must be quantified, including but not limited to diagnostic test accuracy. Methods: we assessed all uk nihr hta reports published may 2009-july 2015. Reports were included if they evaluated a diagnostic test, included a model-based health economic evaluation and included a systematic review and meta-analysis of test accuracy. From each eligible report we extracted information on the following topics: 1) what evidence aside from test accuracy was searched for and synthesised, 2) which methods were used to synthesise test accuracy evidence and how did the results inform the economic model, 3) how/whether threshold effects were explored, 4) how the potential dependency between multiple tests in a pathway was accounted for, and 5) for evaluations of tests targeted at the primary care setting, how evidence from differing healthcare settings was incorporated. Results: the bivariate or hsroc model was implemented in 20/22 reports that met all inclusion criteria. Test accuracy data for health economic modelling was obtained from meta-analyses completely in four reports, partially in fourteen reports and not at all in four reports. Only 2/7 reports that used a quantitative test gave clear threshold recommendations. All 22 reports explored the effect of uncertainty in accuracy parameters but most of those that used multiple tests did not allow for dependence between test results. 7/22 tests were potentially suitable for primary care but the majority found limited evidence on test accuracy in primary care settings. Conclusions: the uptake of appropriate meta-analysis methods for synthesising evidence on diagnostic test accuracy in uk nihr htas has improved in recent years. Future research should focus on other evidence requirements for cost- effectiveness assessment, threshold effects for quantitative tests and the impact of multiple diagnostic tests.","English","Cost-effectiveness; Diagnostic test accuracy; Health-economic model; and HSROC; Meta-analysis; Threshold effects","17",1

In the nephrology setting, home telemonitoring has been evaluated in home dialysis patients but data are scarce concerning chronic kidney disease (ckd) patients before and after renal replacement therapy. The enephro study is designed to assess the cost effectiveness, clinical/biological impact, and patient perception of a home telemonitoring for ckd patients. Our purpose is to present the rationale, design and organisational aspects of this study. Methods: enephro is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial, comparing home telemonitoring versus usual care in three populations of ckd patients: stage 3b/4 (n = 320); stage 5d ckd on dialysis (n = 260); stage 5 t ckd treated with transplantation (n= 260). Five hospitals and three not-for-profit providers managing self-care dialysis situated in three administrative regions in france are participating. The trial began in december 2015, with a scheduled 12-month inclusion period and 12 months follow-up. Outcomes include clinical and biological data (e.g. blood pressure, haemoglobin) collected from patient records, perceived health status (e. g. health related quality of life) collected from self-administered questionnaires, and health expenditure data retrieved from the french health insurance database (sniiram) using a probabilistic matching procedure. Discussion: the hypothesis is that home telemonitoring enables better control of clinical and biological parameters as well as improved perceived health status. This better control should limit emergency consultations and hospitalisations leading to decreased healthcare expenditure, compensating for the financial investment due to the telemedicine system.","English","Chronic kidney disease; Cost-effectiveness evaluation; Dialysis; Home and telemonitoring; Kidney transplantation; Telemedicine","18",1

Methods: the study was designed to retrospectively analyze the telemedicine consultation database at the university of california davis health system (ucdhs) between july 1996 and december 2013. Travel distances and travel times were calculated between the patient home, the telemedicine clinic, and the ucdhs in-person clinic. Travel cost savings and environmental impact were calculated by determining differences in mileage reimbursement rate and emissions between those incurred in attending telemedicine appointments and those that would have been incurred if a visit to the hub site had been necessary. Results: there were 19,246 consultations identified among 11,281 unique patients. Telemedicine visits resulted in a total travel distance savings of 5,345,602 miles, a total travel time savings of 4,708,891 minutes or 8.96 years, and a total direct travel cost savings of $2,882,056. The mean per consultation round-trip distance savings were 278 miles, average travel time savings were 245 minutes, and average cost savings were $156. Telemedicine consultations resulted in a total emissions savings of 1969 metric tons of co2, 50 metric tons of co, 3.7 metric tons of nox, and 5.5 metric tons of volatile organic compounds.

Objective: the aim of this analysis was to examine the same cdr submissions to evaluate whether the negative reimbursement recommendation rate, clinical evidence of efficacy and statements concerning the drug's cost in the cdr reports varied with the prevalence of the disorder treated by the drug grouped into three decreasing categories: <50 to >10, <= 10 to >1, and <= 1 per 100,000. Results: as the prevalence of the treated disorder decreased, the median daily cost of the drug, the negative recommendation rate and the proportion of submissions with statements in the cdr reports highlighting the cost of the drug increased, while the proportion of submissions with acceptable evidence of clinical efficacy decreased. Moreover, although the cadth authors reported that only two submissions received a negative recommendation due to a ""lack of cost-effectiveness/high cost,""high cost was mentioned in the cdr reports of 15 drugs with negative recommendations, all for disorders with a prevalence of <= 10 per 100,000. Conclusions: the aggregated analysis of cdr submissions for drugs for disorders with wide ranging prevalence rates concealed information of concern to patients. The negative reimbursement recommendation rate and the significance of cost in the cdr assessments increased as the prevalence of the treated disorder decreased. Since 2012, the manner in which high cost drugs for rare disorders have been dealt with by the cdr has changed. Cost has ceased to be a factor in negative recommendations but is included in criteria accompanying positive recommendations. This trend is associated with the integration of the cdr process with the system for price negotiation between public drug plans and pharmaceutical companies.","English","Rare diseases; Orphan drugs; Health technology assessment; Canada","12",1

We aimed to demonstrate that pca-perp provides good value for the money and to model the cost ramifications of a similar newly launched system. Methods: as dri was demonstrated to have high diagnostic performance, only the costs of bedside dri-based screening were compared to those of traditional transport and bid-based screening (cost-minimization analysis). The total costs of investment and maintenance were analyzed with micro-costing method. A ten-year analysis time-horizon and service provider's perspective were applied. Results: from the launch of pca-perp up to the end of 2014, 3722 bedside examinations were performed in the pca covered central region of hungary. From 2009 to 2014, pca-perp saved 92,248 km and 3633 staff working hours, with an annual nominal cost-savings ranging from 17,435 to 35,140 euro. The net present value was 127,847 euro at the end of 2014, with a payback period of 4.1 years and an internal rate of return of 20.8%. Our model presented the npvs of different scenarios with different initial investments, annual number of transports and average transport distances. Conclusions: pca-perp as bedside screening with remote interpretation, when compared to a transport-based screening with bio, produced better cost-savings from the perspective of the service provider and provided a return on initial investment within five years after the project initiation.

Methods: the study was a cross-sectional comparative assessment of paper-and electronic-based claims reviews of the nhis. Medical claims of subscribers for the year, 2014 were requested from the claims directorate and analysed. Proportions of claims adjusted by the paper-and electronic-based claims reviews were determined for each type of healthcare facility.

However, while scale-up of mhealth pilots remains limited, health-workers across the continent possess mobile phones. This article draws on interviews from ghana and malawi to ask whether/how health-workers are using their phones informally and with what consequences. Healthworkers were found to use personal mobile phones for a wide range of purposes: obtaining help in emergencies; communicating with patients/colleagues; facilitating community-based care, patient monitoring and medication adherence; obtaining clinical advice/information and managing logistics. However, the costs were being borne by the health-workers themselves, particularly by those at the lower echelons, in rural communities, often on minimal stipends/salaries, who are required to 'care' even at substantial personal cost. Although there is significant potential for 'informal mhealth' to improve (rural) healthcare, there is a risk that the associated moral and political economies of care will reinforce existing socioeconomic and geographic inequalities.","English","Care work; community health-workers; mobile phones; moral economy; and political economy; Sub-Saharan Africa; task shifting","32",1

However the security of these systems needs more consideration for the sensitive health information of patients. Some protocols on how to secure the e-health cloud system have been proposed, but many of them use the traditional pki infrastructure to implement cryptographic mechanisms, which is cumbersome for they require every user having and remembering its own public/private keys. Identity based encryption (ibe) is a cryptographic primitive which uses the identity information of the user (e.g., email address) as the public key. Hence the public key is implicitly authenticated and the certificate management is simplified. Proxy re-encryption is another cryptographic primitive which aims at transforming a ciphertext under the delegator a into another ciphertext which can be decrypted by the delegatee b. In this paper, we describe several identity related cryptographic techniques for securing e-health system, which include new ibe schemes, new identity based proxy re-encryption (ibpre) schemes. We also prove these schemes' security and give the performance analysis, the results show our ibpre scheme is especially highly efficient for re-encryption, which can be used to achieve cost-effective cloud usage.

However, few data are available on the socioeconomic impact of rm. Objective the aim of this study was to assess the costs and benefits of rm compared with standard care (sc). Methods we used 12-month patient data from the health economics evaluation registry for remote follow-up (tariff) study (n = 209; rm: n = 102 (48.81%); sc: n = 107 (51.19%)). Cost comparison was made from 2 perspectives: the health care system (hcs) and patients. The use of health care resources was defined on the basis of hospital clinical folders. Out-of-pocket expenses were reported directly by patients. Results hcs perspective: the overall mean annual cost per patient in the sc group ((sic)1044.89 +/- (sic)1990.47) was significantly higher than in the rm group ((sic)482.87 +/- (sic)2488.10) (p <.0001), with a reduction of 53.87% being achieved in the rm group. The primary driver of cost reduction was the cost of cardiovascular hospitalizations (sc: (sic)886.67 +/- 1979.13 vs rm: (sic)432.34 +/- (sic)2488.10; p =.0030). Patient and caregiver perspective: the annual cost incurred by patients was significantly higher in the sc group than in the rm group (sc: (sic)169.49 +/- (sic)189.50 vs rm: (sic)56.87 +/-(sic) 80.22; p <.0001). Patients quality -adjusted life -years were not significantly different between the groups. Provider perspective: the total number of inhospital device follow-up visits was reduced by 58.78% in the rm group. Conclusion rm of patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (cieds) is cost saving from the perspectives of the hcs, patients, and caregivers. Introducing appropriate reimbursements will make rm sustainable even for the provider, i.e. the hospitals which provide the service and encourage widespread adoption of rm.","English","Telemedicine; Remote monitoring; Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator; and Reimbursement; Cost-effectiveness","14",1

This study assessed community experiences of health resource usage and perceived cost-drivers from a societal perspective to inform the design of an economic model for the community level interventions for pre-eclampsia (clip) trials. Methods: qualitative research was undertaken alongside the clip trial in two districts of sindh province, pakistan. Nine focus groups were conducted with a wide range of stakeholders, including pregnant women, mothers-in-law, husbands, fathers-in-law, healthcare providers at community and health facility-levels, and health decision/ policy makers at district-level. The societal perspective included out-of-pocket (oop), health system, and program implementation costs related to clip. Thematic analysis was performed using nvivo software. Results: most pregnant women and male decision makers reported a large burden of oop costs for in-and out-patient care, informal care from traditional healers, self-medication, childbirth, newborn care, transport to health facility, and missed wages by caretakers. Many healthcare providers identified health system costs associated with human resources for hypertension risk assessment, transport, and communication about patient referrals. Health decision/policy makers recognized program implementation costs (such as the mobile health infrastructure, staff training, and monitoring/supervision) as major investments for the health system. Conclusions: our investigation of care-seeking practices revealed financial implications for families of pregnant women, and program implementation costs for the health system. The societal perspective provided comprehensive knowledge of cost drivers to guide an economic appraisal of the clip trial in sindh, pakistan.","English","Health technology assessment; Cost drivers; Economic model; Maternal; and newborn; and child health (MNCH); Low-and middle-income-countries and (LMICs)","33",1

Using mobile technology, health-care providers can access clinical information and communicate with subjects in real-time. Due to the sensitive nature of health-care applications, these systems need to process physiological signals highly accurately. However, as mobile devices are employed in dynamic environments, the accuracy of a machine learning model drops whenever a change in configuration of the system occurs. Therefore, data mining and machine learning techniques that specifically address challenges associated with dynamic environments (e.g. different users, signal heterogeneity) are needed. In this paper, using active learning as an organizing principle, we propose a cost-optimal multiple-expert architecture to adapt a machine learning model (e.g. classifier) developed in a given context to a new context or configuration. More specifically, in our architecture, a system's machine learning model learns from experts available to the system (e.g. another mobile device, human annotator) while minimizing the cost of data labeling. Our architecture also exploits collaboration between experts to enrich their knowledge which in turn decreases both cost and uncertainty of data labeling in future steps. We demonstrate the efficacy of the architecture using a publicly available dataset on human activity. We show that the accuracy of activity recognition reaches over 85% by labeling only 15% of unlabeled data. At the same time, the number of queries from human expert is reduced by up to 82%.","English","Mobile Health Monitoring; Wearables; Active Learning; Cost-Optimal; Time and Series; Uncertainty; Query Strategy; Physical Activity Recognition; and Collaborative; Multi-Expert; Accelerometer",NA,1

Though 259,000 mobile health apps are available worldwide, only a small portion accounts for the majority of the market. Half of the downloads come from less than 100 applications, 62% of mhealth app publishers earn less than usd 10,000 or have no revenue, while the top 3% makes over usd 5 million. According to our experience, the discoverability of telemedicine applications is rather poor and users' demand could not meet the vast supply. It is difficult to find proper solutions mostly because of the lack of adequate categorization. Hence it is important to recommend and systematically apply a comprehensive categorization, accepted by major stakeholders. Though there have been various attempts, so far the disciplines involved (medicine, it and economics) could not provide a relevant classification. We would recommend the following categorization aspects: target audience - operating environment - medical discipline - type of application - sensor could determine the possible application more clearly. Finally, legal & business aspects are also included, in response to different audits and pricing mechanisms of telemedicine applications.","English","telemedicine; economy; categorisation",NA,1

The purpose of this study is to review the process of judicialization of the access to high cost drugs in uruguay and assess the impact htas have had on this process. Methods: the methodology used for this study included a comprehensive literature search in electronic databases, local journals, internal documents developed in the ministry of health, as well as conducting interviews with key informants. Results: judicialization of the access of high cost drugs has been increasing since 2010. The strategy of the ministry of health of uruguay to decrease this problem included the organization of roundtables with judges and other stakeholders on the basis of hta, the training of defense lawyers in the use and interpretation of hta, and the participation of a professional who develops hta in the preparation of the defense arguments. A year after the implementation of this strategy, 25 percent of writs of protection were won by the ministry of health. Conclusions: even though the strategy implemented was effective in reducing the loss of litigations, it was not effective in reducing the growing number of writs of protection.

Methods: a cohort study was conducted using primary care electronic health records, with linked hospital utilization data, for 3,045 participants who underwent bariatric surgery and 247,537 participants who did not undergo bariatric surgery. Epidemiological analyses informed a probabilistic markov model to compare bariatric surgery, including equal proportions with adjustable gastric banding, gastric bypass, and sleeve gastrectomy, with standard nonsurgical management of obesity. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (qalys) and net monetary benefits at a threshold of 30,000 per qaly. Results: in a uk population of 250,000 adults, there may be 7,163 people with morbid obesity including 1,406 with diabetes. The immediate cost of 1,000 bariatric surgical procedures is 9.16 million, with incremental discounted lifetime health care costs of 15.26 million (95% confidence interval 15.18- 15.36 million). Patient-years with diabetes mellitus will decrease by 8,320 (range 8,123-8,502). Incremental qalys will increase by 2,142 (range 2,032-2,256). The estimated cost per qaly gained is 7,129 (range 6,775- 7,506). Net monetary benefits will be 49.02 million (range 45.72- 52.41 million). Estimates are similar for subgroups of age, sex, and deprivation. Bariatric surgery remains costeffective if the procedure is twice as costly, or if intervention effect declines over time. Conclusions: diverse obese individuals may benefit from bariatric surgery at acceptable cost. Bariatric surgery is not cost-saving, but increased health care costs are exceeded by health benefits to obese individuals.","English","bariatric surgery; cost-effectiveness analysis; diabetes mellitus; and obesity","20",1

This analysis aimed to analyze trajectory of healthcare cost before, during, and after a behavioral activation intervention delivered via telepsychology and same-room delivery to elderly veterans with depression. Methods: 241 participants were randomly assigned into one of two study groups: behavioral activation for depression via telemedicine or via same-room treatment. Patients received 8 weeks of weekly 60-min individual sessions of behavioral activation for depression. Primary outcomes were collected at 12-months. Inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and total costs were collected from va health economics resource center (herc) datasets for fy 1998-2014 and compared between the two treatment groups. Generalized mixed models were used to investigate the trajectories over time. Results: overall cost, as well as, outpatient and pharmacy cost show increasing trend over time. Unadjusted and adjusted trajectories over time for any cost were not different between the two treatment groups. There was a significant overall increasing trend over time for outpatient (p < 0.001) and total cost (p < 0.001) but not for inpatient (p=0.543) or pharmacy cost (p=0.084). Limitations: generalizability to younger, healthier populations may be limited due to inclusion criteria for study participants. Conclusion: healthcare costs before, during, and after intervention did not differ between the telemedicine and in-person delivery methods. Outpatient costs accounted for most of the increasing trend of cost over time. These results support policies to use both telehealth and in-person treatment modalities to effectively and efficiently provide high quality care.","English","Telemedicine; Depression; Cost; Behavioral activation; Telepsychology; and Elderly","207",1
